# Story 2.2: Search ViewModel and State Management

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want a ViewModel to manage the state of the search query and handle the logic for initiating a search, so that the UI remains responsive and state is handled correctly.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 2.1 (Search Input UI). It introduces a `SearchViewModel` to manage the search query text and the action of initiating a search. This decouples UI logic from the Composable screen, adhering to MVVM principles. Hilt (from Story 1.7) will be used for ViewModel creation and injection.

## Detailed Requirements

* Create a Hilt ViewModel (e.g., `SearchViewModel`) associated with the search input UI (`HomeScreen`).
* The ViewModel should hold the current search query string as observable state (e.g., using `MutableStateFlow<String>`).
* The ViewModel should expose a function to update the search query state (e.g., `onQueryChanged(newQuery: String)`).
* The ViewModel should expose a function to be called when the user initiates a search (e.g., `onSearchClicked()`).
* The `TextField` in `HomeScreen` should now get its value from and report its changes to the `SearchViewModel`.
* The search initiation function in the ViewModel (`onSearchClicked()`) should validate that the search query (from `StateFlow`) is not empty before proceeding (e.g., log a message or set a temporary state if invalid for now).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: A `SearchViewModel.kt` is created in the `ui.home` package, annotated with `@HiltViewModel`.
-   AC2: `SearchViewModel` manages the search query string in a `MutableStateFlow` (e.g., `searchQuery: StateFlow<String>`) and exposes a public `onQueryChanged(String)` method to update it.
-   AC3: The `HomeScreen`'s `TextField` value is driven by `searchQuery` from `SearchViewModel` (collected as state), and `onValueChange` calls `viewModel.onQueryChanged()`.
-   AC4: `SearchViewModel` has an `onSearchClicked()` function. When called, it checks if `searchQuery.value` is blank. If blank, it does not proceed with search logic (e.g., logs a warning). If not blank, it proceeds (e.g., logs the query to be searched).
-   AC5: `SearchViewModel` is correctly injected into `HomeScreen` using `hiltViewModel()`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Story 2.1 is complete and Hilt (Story 1.7) is set up.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Create:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (to use the ViewModel).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` for package location. `docs/coding-standards.md` for ViewModel and StateFlow usage.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Hilt (`@HiltViewModel`, `@Inject constructor`).
    -   Jetpack ViewModel (`androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`).
    -   Kotlin Coroutines & Flow (`StateFlow`, `MutableStateFlow`, `viewModelScope`).
    -   Jetpack Compose (`collectAsStateWithLifecycle` or `collectAsState` for observing StateFlow).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` and `docs/coding-standards.md` for async operations and immutability.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable for this story (API call is Story 2.3).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `MutableStateFlow<String>` for the search query within `SearchViewModel`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   ViewModel should expose state via `StateFlow` (immutable public property) and have internal `MutableStateFlow`.
    -   Use `viewModelScope` for launching coroutines if any async work were done here (not yet).
    -   Method naming: `onQueryChanged`, `onSearchClicked`.
    -   Follow MVVM principles for separation of concerns.
    -   Adhere to Kotlin Flow best practices as per `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Create `SearchViewModel.kt` in `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/`.
    -   [x] Annotate class with `@HiltViewModel`.
    -   [x] Add `@Inject constructor()`.
    -   [x] Define `private val _searchQuery = MutableStateFlow("")`.
    -   [x] Define `val searchQuery: StateFlow<String> = _searchQuery.asStateFlow()`.
    -   [x] Create `fun onQueryChanged(newQuery: String)` that updates `_searchQuery.value = newQuery`.
    -   [x] Create `fun onSearchClicked()`:
        -   [x] Check if `_searchQuery.value.isNotBlank()`.
        -   [x] If blank, log a message like "Search query is empty."
        -   [x] If not blank, log "Search initiated for: ${_searchQuery.value}". (Actual search logic comes in Story 2.3).
-   [x] Modify `HomeScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] Inject `SearchViewModel`: `val viewModel: SearchViewModel = hiltViewModel()`.
    -   [x] Collect `searchQuery` state: `val currentQuery by viewModel.searchQuery.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`. (Add `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose` dependency if `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` is not found).
    -   [x] Bind `OutlinedTextField`'s `value` parameter to `currentQuery`.
    -   [x] Call `viewModel.onQueryChanged(it)` in `OutlinedTextField`'s `onValueChange` lambda.
    -   [x] Call `viewModel.onSearchClicked()` in the `onClick` lambda of the search `Button`/`IconButton`.
-   [x] Ensure `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose` (for `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`) is added to `app/build.gradle.kts` if not already present. (Check `docs/tech-stack.md` if it implies this, if not add e.g. `libs.androidx.lifecycle.runtimeCompose`).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   [x] Test `onQueryChanged` updates `searchQuery` StateFlow correctly. Use Turbine for testing Flow emissions.
    -   [x] Test `onSearchClicked`:
        -   [x] Verify it doesn't proceed (e.g., doesn't log "Search initiated" or attempt further action) if query is blank.
        -   [x] Verify it proceeds (e.g., logs "Search initiated") if query is not blank.
    -   [x] Mock any dependencies if there were any (none for this story in the ViewModel itself, but `android.util.Log` was mocked).
    -   _(Use JUnit 4, MockK, Turbine as per `docs/testing-strategy.md`)_
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests):**
    -   (To be written more formally later) For manual verification now:
    -   Confirm typing in `TextField` updates the ViewModel's state (can be checked by debugging or logging from ViewModel).
    -   Confirm clicking search button calls `onSearchClicked` in ViewModel.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1, AC2: Review `SearchViewModel.kt` code.
    -   AC3: Run app. Type in `TextField`. Verify text updates. If possible, debug/log `searchQuery.value` in ViewModel to confirm it's in sync.
    -   AC4: With query empty, click search. Check Logcat for "Search query is empty." (or similar). With query non-empty, click search. Check Logcat for "Search initiated for: [your_query]".
    -   AC5: App should run without Hilt injection errors related to `SearchViewModel`.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for detailed testing approaches)_
