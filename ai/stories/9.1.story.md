# Story 9.1: Implement Shared Element Transition for Image Detail View

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I tap on an image in the results grid, I want the image to smoothly animate and transition from its position in the grid to its place in the image detail view, creating a seamless and visually connected experience.

**Context:** This story introduces a significant UI polish by implementing a shared element transition for images. It aims to make the navigation between `SearchResultsListComposable` (or the screen hosting it) and `ImageDetailScreen` (or `ImageDetailPaneComposable`) more fluid and engaging. This relies on advanced Jetpack Compose animation capabilities, as researched in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [264-265, 280] and outlined in PRD v1.1 [322].

## Detailed Requirements

* Investigate and implement shared element transition primarily using Jetpack Compose's `LookaheadLayout` if suitable for coordinating the layout and animation of the tapped image from the results grid to the detail view.
* The transition should animate properties like size, position, and potentially aspect ratio correction if the aspect ratio differs significantly between the grid item and the detail view presentation.
* Ensure state (e.g., scroll position of the grid) is managed correctly so the reverse transition (from detail back to grid) targets the correct grid item, even if it was previously off-screen.
* Pass necessary information (e.g., unique photo ID, potentially a stable modifier key for the shared element) as part of the navigation action or through a shared ViewModel if `LookaheadLayout` is used across different navigation destinations or Composable scopes.
* Ensure the reverse transition is also smooth, visually consistent, and correctly handles the image animating back to its grid cell.
* If `LookaheadLayout` directly between separate navigation destinations proves too complex or has limitations, explore alternative advanced Compose animation techniques (e.g., manual coordination of animations using shared state and `Animatable`) before considering View system interop for shared elements (which is to be avoided).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When an image in the results grid (`ImageItem` in `SearchResultsListComposable`) is tapped, it animates (scales and moves) smoothly from its grid position to its final position/size in `ImageDetailScreen` or `ImageDetailPaneComposable`.
* AC2: When navigating back from the detail view, the image animates smoothly back to its corresponding position and size in the results grid. This should work even if the grid item was previously scrolled off-screen and then scrolled back into view.
* AC3: The transition is performant (targets 60fps consistently) and visually polished, without jarring jumps or visual artifacts.
* AC4: The transition correctly handles images of various aspect ratios, ensuring the animation looks natural.
* AC5: The implementation is primarily Compose-based, ideally leveraging `LookaheadLayout` or comparable advanced Compose animation/layout APIs if suitable for the navigation structure.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Epics 1-8 are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Create/Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (or host screen if it manages navigation items directly).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` (and/or `ImageDetailPaneComposable.kt`).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt` (may need to expose a shared element modifier or key).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (if transition animations are tied to navigation routes).
    * _(Hint: `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [264, 265] for shared element research. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for UI Animations section.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `LookaheadLayout` (experimental, requires `OptIn`), `Animatable`, `animate*AsState`, `Modifier.intermediateLayout`, `Modifier.sharedElement` (if a simpler API emerges or is used via a library extension), custom layout coordination.
    * Jetpack Navigation Compose (for defining transitions if possible at the navigation level).
    * Keying items in `LazyVerticalGrid` and potentially image elements for stable identification.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1. Consult latest Compose animation documentation for shared element patterns.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * State to manage animation progress/values.
    * Unique identifiers for shared elements (e.g., `photo.id`).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Shared element transitions can be complex. Prioritize a clean, understandable implementation.
    * Performance is paramount; profile these animations carefully.
    * Ensure accessibility: screen readers should still announce navigation correctly.
    * Adhere to "UI Animations and Transitions" in `docs/coding-standards.md` (v1.1).
    * Fallback to simpler fade/slide if shared element proves too unstable or complex for MVP of this bonus feature, but aim for shared element.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Research & Prototyping (if needed):** Based on `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md`, thoroughly investigate current best practices for shared element transitions in Jetpack Compose across navigation destinations, primarily focusing on `LookaheadLayout`. Create a small prototype if the exact mechanism is unclear.
* [ ] **Identify Shared Elements:** The `AsyncImage` within `ImageItem.kt` (grid) and the main `AsyncImage` in `ImageDetailScreen.kt` (or `ImageDetailPaneComposable.kt`) are the shared elements. They need a common, stable identifier (e.g., `photo.id.toString()`).
* [ ] **Implement with `LookaheadLayout` (Primary approach):**
    * [ ] Wrap the relevant parts of the navigation graph or screen content where the shared element appears (both list and detail) within a `LookaheadLayout` scope. This might mean `LookaheadLayout` at a higher level in `AppNavigation.kt` or the screen hosting list/detail panes.
    * [ ] Use `Modifier.intermediateLayout` within `LookaheadScope` on the shared `AsyncImage` Composables. This modifier allows you to define how the Composable should measure and place itself during the lookahead pass versus the main pass.
    * [ ] Coordinate animations of size and position based on measurements from both the start and end states derived from `LookaheadLayout`. This might involve using `Animatable` or custom animation drivers that react to changes in `LookaheadLayout`'s measurements.
* [ ] **Navigation Setup:**
    * Ensure the navigation action to `ImageDetailScreen` passes the unique ID of the photo.
    * The `ImageDetailScreen` (or its ViewModel) will use this ID to identify which image to display and potentially to correlate for the shared element transition.
* [ ] **Handle Reverse Transition:** Ensure the animation back to the grid is also implemented, correctly targeting the (potentially off-screen) grid item. `LookaheadLayout` should aid in this.
* [ ] **State Management for Grid Scroll:** The `LazyVerticalGridState` must be considered. If navigating back to an item that was scrolled off-screen, the grid may need to be scrolled to that item's position for the animation to target correctly.
* [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Profile the transition. Ensure smooth animations by optimizing any calculations or recompositions during the transition.
* [ ] **Fallback/Alternative (If `LookaheadLayout` is problematic for cross-nav-destination):**
    * If direct shared element transition across Navigation Compose destinations with `LookaheadLayout` is too difficult, consider a custom approach:
        * On click, capture start bounds.
        * Navigate, passing start bounds and photo ID.
        * In detail screen, animate from start bounds to final bounds.
        * This is more manual and might not be as seamless but can be a fallback. This should be a last resort.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not primary for complex animation orchestration, but any helper functions for calculating bounds or animation targets could be unit tested.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later, can be challenging for animations)
    * Verify navigation occurs.
    * Attempt to assert properties of the image (e.g., visibility, position) at different stages of an emulated transition if the test framework allows for fine-grained animation control or inspection.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 for UI tests on animations.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
    * AC1: Click an image in the grid. Visually confirm it animates smoothly (scales, moves) to the detail view.
    * AC2: Navigate back from detail view. Confirm smooth animation back to its grid position. Test with items that were initially off-screen (scroll down, select, go back).
    * AC3: Perform transitions repeatedly. Observe frame rate using Profiler or visual smoothness. Target 60fps.
    * AC4: Test with images of different aspect ratios (tall, wide, square). Confirm animation looks correct.
    * AC5: Review code to confirm primary use of Compose animation APIs.
