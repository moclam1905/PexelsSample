# Story 8.7: Manage Search History Data Integrity

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure search history data is managed correctly, avoiding duplicates and respecting user privacy by storing it locally and normalized.

**Context:** This story focuses on the backend logic within `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl` for maintaining the integrity of the search history data stored in DataStore. It includes normalization, duplicate handling, and size limiting. This is crucial for a robust search history feature, as researched in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [250-253].

## Detailed Requirements

* In `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl` (when `addSearchTerm` is called, which `SearchViewModel` will trigger after a successful search for a *new* query):
    * Normalize the search term before saving (e.g., convert to lowercase, trim leading/trailing whitespace).
    * Retrieve the current list of (normalized) search terms from `SearchHistoryDataStoreManager`.
    * If the newly normalized term already exists in the list, remove its old instance.
    * Add the new (or existing but now re-searched) normalized term to the *beginning* of the list (to mark it as most recent).
    * If the list's size now exceeds the predefined maximum (e.g., `SearchHistoryKeys.MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 10`), remove the oldest item(s) from the end of the list until it's within the limit.
    * Save the updated, potentially trimmed, list back to DataStore via `SearchHistoryDataStoreManager`.
* Ensure search history is only stored locally on the device (which DataStore Preferences does by default).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When a new search is successfully performed, the `SearchViewModel` calls `searchHistoryRepository.addSearchTerm()` with the query.
* AC2: In `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl.addSearchTerm()`:
    * The search term is normalized (e.g., " Cats " becomes "cats").
    * If the normalized term already exists in history, it's moved to the beginning (most recent). No duplicates of the normalized term are stored.
    * The new/updated term is placed at the beginning of the history list.
* AC3: The search history stored in DataStore (and thus retrieved by `getRecentSearches`) is limited to `SearchHistoryKeys.MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` entries, with the oldest entries being automatically removed if the limit is exceeded.
* AC4: `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl.deleteSearchTerm(term)` also works with normalized terms.
* AC5: `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl.clearSearchHistory()` correctly empties the stored list.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 8.4 (DataStore setup) and initial repository methods are in place.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/repository/SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt` (to call `addSearchTerm` after a search).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/local/datastore/SearchHistoryKeys.kt` (to ensure `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` is defined).
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` v1.1. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [250-253] for data integrity logic.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl`, `SearchHistoryDataStoreManager`.
    * Kotlin collection manipulation functions (`map`, `filter`, `toMutableList`, `add(0, element)`, `remove`, `take`).
    * String manipulation (`toLowerCase()`, `trim()`).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Interacts with `SearchHistoryDataStoreManager`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * `List<String>` for manipulating history in memory.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` v1.1.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * All list manipulation logic should be clear and correct.
    * Ensure thread safety (DataStore operations are already suspend functions).
    * Normalization rules should be consistently applied.
    * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Ensure `SearchHistoryKeys.MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` is defined (e.g., as `10`).
* [ ] **Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:**
    * [ ] In the `onSearchClicked()` method (or wherever a new search is successfully executed for a non-blank query), after the API call and before resetting loading states:
        * Call `viewModelScope.launch { searchHistoryRepository.addSearchTerm(_searchQuery.value) }`.
* [ ] **Enhance `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl.kt`:**
    * [ ] **`addSearchTerm(term: String)` method:**
        * Normalize `term` (e.g., `val normalizedTerm = term.trim().lowercase()`). If `normalizedTerm` is blank, return.
        * Read current history: `val currentHistory = searchHistoryDataStoreManager.getSearchHistory().firstOrNull() ?: emptyList()`. (Use `firstOrNull()` to get current state from Flow for modification).
        * Create a mutable list: `val mutableHistory = currentHistory.toMutableList()`.
        * Remove any existing instance of `normalizedTerm`: `mutableHistory.removeAll { it.equals(normalizedTerm, ignoreCase = true) }`.
        * Add `normalizedTerm` to the beginning: `mutableHistory.add(0, normalizedTerm)`.
        * Trim list if it exceeds `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`: `val finalHistory = if (mutableHistory.size > SearchHistoryKeys.MAX_HISTORY_SIZE) mutableHistory.take(SearchHistoryKeys.MAX_HISTORY_SIZE) else mutableHistory`.
        * Save: `searchHistoryDataStoreManager.saveSearchHistory(finalHistory)`.
    * [ ] **`deleteSearchTerm(term: String)` method:**
        * Normalize `term`.
        * Read current history.
        * Remove all instances of normalized `term`.
        * Save updated history.
    * [ ] **`getRecentSearches(limit: Int)` method:**
        * Should already read from DataStore. Ensure it respects the `limit` parameter if DataStore doesn't handle it intrinsically (i.e., apply `take(limit)` after deserialization if manager returns full list). `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` is the storage limit; `getRecentSearches` might request fewer for display. The repository should return what's stored up to the internal `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`, and the ViewModel can decide how many to `take()` for display. *Clarification: `getRecentSearches` should return the stored list (up to `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`, already ordered most recent first by `addSearchTerm`), and the ViewModel requesting it can apply a further display `limit`.* So, repository's `getRecentSearches` might not need a `limit` param if always returning the full stored history. For now, let's assume it returns the full persisted list (up to `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`).
* [ ] Ensure `SearchHistoryDataStoreManager.getSearchHistory()` returns items in the order they were saved (most recent first if `add(0, ...)` is used).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `SearchHistoryRepositoryImpl.kt`):**
    * Mock `SearchHistoryDataStoreManager`.
    * Test `addSearchTerm`:
        * Adding a new term: verify it's normalized, added to start, list trimmed if over max size.
        * Adding an existing term (case-insensitively): verify it moves to start, no duplicates.
        * Adding a blank/whitespace term: verify it's ignored.
    * Test `deleteSearchTerm`: verify term is removed (case-insensitively).
    * Test `clearSearchHistory`: verify empty list is saved.
* **Integration Tests (with real DataStore in instrumented tests):**
    * Perform sequences of add, delete, clear operations.
    * After each operation, read back from DataStore via `getRecentSearches` and verify the list content, order, and size are correct according to the rules.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Perform a search. Check (via logs/debugger if needed, or by Story 8.5/8.6 UI) that `addSearchTerm` is called.
    * AC2, AC3: Perform various searches:
        * "Cats", then "Dogs" -> History: ["dogs", "cats"]
        * Search "cats" again -> History: ["cats", "dogs"]
        * Search " birds " -> History: ["birds", "cats", "dogs"]
        * Continue searching until `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` is exceeded. Verify oldest terms are dropped and most recent `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` are kept.
    * AC4, AC5: Verify delete and clear (from Story 8.6 UI) correctly interact with this backend logic.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [250-253].)_
