# Story 1.6: Room Database Initialization

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want Room database initialized in the project, so that local data persistence for caching and future features like bookmarks is available.

**Context:** This story sets up local database infrastructure using Room, based on `docs/data-models.md` for entities (`CachedPhotoEntity`, `CachedPhotoSrcEntity`). This foundation will be injectable via Hilt (Story 1.7).

## Detailed Requirements

* Add Room dependencies (runtime, KTX, compiler - KSP preferred).
* Define `CachedPhotoEntity` and `CachedPhotoSrcEntity` Room Entities as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* Define a `PhotoDao` interface.
* Create a `PexelsRoomDatabase` class extending `RoomDatabase`.
* Provide the database and DAO instances via Hilt.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: Room dependencies (runtime, KTX, compiler using KSP) are added via `libs.versions.toml` and configured.
-   AC2: `CachedPhotoEntity`, `CachedPhotoSrcEntity`, and `PhotoDao` are defined as per `docs/data-models.md`.
-   AC3: `PexelsRoomDatabase` class is created, annotated (`@Database`), and includes an abstract method for `PhotoDao`.
-   AC4: Room database and `PhotoDao` can be provided via Hilt (`DatabaseModule.kt`) and injected successfully. App compiles and runs without database-related errors.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Create:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/local/model/CachedPhotoEntity.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/local/model/CachedPhotoSrcEntity.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/local/dao/PhotoDao.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/local/PexelsRoomDatabase.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/di/DatabaseModule.kt`
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `libs.versions.toml` (add Room dependencies).
        -   `app/build.gradle.kts` (apply KSP plugin, implement Room dependencies).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` and `docs/data-models.md`)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Room (`libs.androidx.room.runtime`, `libs.androidx.room.ktx`, `libs.androidx.room.compiler`). KSP for compiler.
    -   Hilt (for DI).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for versions and `docs/coding-standards.md` for Room usage)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Entities `CachedPhotoEntity` (`@Entity`, `@PrimaryKey`, `@Embedded(prefix = "src_")`) and `CachedPhotoSrcEntity` as per `docs/data-models.md`.
    -   `PhotoDao` (`@Dao`) - initially empty or with a placeholder method.
    -   `PexelsRoomDatabase` (`@Database(entities = [CachedPhotoEntity::class], version = 1, exportSchema = false)`).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/data-models.md` for definitions)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Use KSP for Room compiler.
    -   Database name: "pexels_database".
    -   `exportSchema = false` for MVP is acceptable.
    -   DAO methods (to be added later) should be `suspend` or return `Flow`.
    -   Follow Hilt module conventions from `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] Add Room dependencies (runtime, ktx, compiler) and KSP plugin to `libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle.kts`.
-   [ ] Create `CachedPhotoSrcEntity.kt` in `data/local/model/` as per `docs/data-models.md`.
-   [ ] Create `CachedPhotoEntity.kt` in `data/local/model/` as per `docs/data-models.md`.
-   [ ] Create `PhotoDao.kt` interface in `data/local/dao/` annotated with `@Dao` (can be empty initially).
-   [ ] Create `PexelsRoomDatabase.kt` abstract class in `data/local/` extending `RoomDatabase`, annotated, with abstract `photoDao()`.
-   [ ] Create `DatabaseModule.kt` in `di/` to provide `PexelsRoomDatabase` and `PhotoDao` as `@Singleton` Hilt bindings. Use `@ApplicationContext`.
-   [ ] Build project to ensure Room entities are processed and Hilt modules are valid.
-   [ ] (For AC4 Verification) Temporarily inject `PhotoDao` into a Hilt ViewModel and log to confirm successful instantiation.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   DAO methods tested later.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Database interactions tested later.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Verify dependencies and build success.
    -   AC2, AC3: Review created files against `docs/data-models.md`.
    -   AC4: Run app. If temporary injection added, check Logcat for confirmation of DAO/DB instantiation without errors. App should not crash due to DB setup.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
