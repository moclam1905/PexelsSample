# Story 1.2: Secure API Key Management

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to securely store and access the Pexels API key, so that it is not exposed in version control or easily accessible in the compiled application.

**Context:** This story builds upon the initialized project (Story 1.1). It's a critical early step to ensure that sensitive credentials like the Pexels API key are handled securely from the outset, before any networking calls are made. This follows the security best practices outlined in `docs/coding-standards.md` and `docs/environment-vars.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

* Store the Pexels API key in a way that it's not hardcoded directly in source files committed to version control (e.g., using `gradle.properties` and `BuildConfig` fields).
* Provide a mechanism for the application to access this API key at runtime for API requests.
* Ensure the file containing the API key (e.g., local `gradle.properties`) is listed in `.gitignore`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: The Pexels API key is stored in a local `gradle.properties` file, which is listed in `.gitignore`.
-   AC2: The application can retrieve the API key at runtime via `BuildConfig.PEXELS_API_KEY`.
-   AC3: The method used (Gradle property to `BuildConfig` field) aligns with standard Android practices for key security as outlined in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
-   AC4: A `gradle.properties.nguyenmoclam` file is created and committed, showing a placeholder for the API key.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Create:
        -   `gradle.properties` (in project root, containing the actual key; ensure it's gitignored).
        -   `gradle.properties.nguyenmoclam` (in project root, with a placeholder; to be committed).
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/build.gradle.kts` (to read the property and add to `BuildConfig`).
        -   `.gitignore` (in project root).
        -   A temporary Kotlin file (e.g., `MainActivity.kt`) for verifying AC2.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Gradle (`gradle.properties` file).
    -   `BuildConfig` (Android generated class).
    -   Kotlin (for accessing `BuildConfig`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for details on external APIs and SDKs)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for key project data structures)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   `PEXELS_API_KEY` (This is the name of the property to be defined in `gradle.properties`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for `BuildConfig` generation details and `docs/coding-standards.md` for the API key management strategy)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Property name in `gradle.properties`: `PEXELS_API_KEY`.
    -   `BuildConfig` field name: `PEXELS_API_KEY`.
    -   Ensure `gradle.properties` (with the real key) is correctly added to `.gitignore` *before* committing any changes if the file is created locally with a key.
    -   The approach should match the "API Key Management" section in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] Create `gradle.properties` file in the project root directory (if it doesn't exist for local use).
    -   [ ] Add the line `PEXELS_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_PEXELS_API_KEY"` to this file. (Developer replaces placeholder with their actual key).
-   [ ] Add/ensure `gradle.properties` is listed in the root `.gitignore` file.
-   [ ] Create `gradle.properties.nguyenmoclam` file in the project root.
    -   [ ] Add the line `PEXELS_API_KEY="YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER"` to this file.
    -   [ ] Commit `gradle.properties.nguyenmoclam` to version control.
-   [ ] Modify `app/build.gradle.kts`:
    -   [ ] In the `android.defaultConfig` block, add a `buildConfigField` to expose the `PEXELS_API_KEY` as detailed in `docs/environment-vars.md` and `docs/coding-standards.md`.
        ```kotlin
        val pexelsApiKey = project.findProperty("PEXELS_API_KEY") as? String ?: "" // For local builds
        // For CI, System.getenv("PEXELS_API_KEY") would be primary. For MVP, local is focus.
        buildConfigField("String", "PEXELS_API_KEY", "\"$pexelsApiKey\"")
        ```
-   [ ] Rebuild the project (Sync Gradle files).
-   [ ] Temporarily modify `MainActivity.kt` to access and log `BuildConfig.PEXELS_API_KEY` to verify AC2.
    ```kotlin
    // In MainActivity.onCreate
    // import com.nguyenmoclam.pexelssample.BuildConfig
    // import android.util.Log
    // Log.d("API_KEY_TEST", "Pexels API Key: ${BuildConfig.PEXELS_API_KEY}")
    ```
-   [ ] Run the app and check Logcat for the logged API key.
-   [ ] Remove the temporary logging code from `MainActivity.kt` after verification.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Not directly testable with unit tests.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Verify that `gradle.properties` (containing the actual key) is gitignored. Verify `gradle.properties.nguyenmoclam` is committed.
    -   AC2: Run the app with temporary logging and check Logcat to see if the API key from the local `gradle.properties` is correctly printed.
    -   AC3: Review the implementation in `app/build.gradle.kts` and confirm it matches the strategy in `docs/coding-standards.md` and `docs/environment-vars.md`.
    -   AC4: Check `gradle.properties.nguyenmoclam` exists and contains the placeholder.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
