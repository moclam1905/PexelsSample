# Story 7.2: Adapt Search Results Grid to Screen Width

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the grid of image search results to utilize screen space effectively by showing more columns on wider screens and fewer columns on narrower screens.

**Context:** This story applies the `WindowSizeClass` mechanism (from Story 7.1) to make the `SearchResultsScreen` (from Epic 3) responsive. The number of columns in the `LazyVerticalGrid` will adapt based on the available width. This is a core requirement for adaptive layouts as per PRD v1.1 [314] and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [201, 202, 205].

## Detailed Requirements

* In `SearchResultsScreen.kt`, consume the `WindowSizeClass` (provided via parameter or `CompositionLocal` from Story 7.1).
* Use a `when` expression based on `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` to determine the number of columns for the `LazyVerticalGrid`:
    * `WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact`: e.g., 2 columns.
    * `WindowWidthSizeClass.Medium`: e.g., 3 columns.
    * `WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded`: e.g., 4 or 5 columns. (Let's target 2, 3, 4 for simplicity unless 5 looks significantly better on very wide expanded views).
* The `ImageItem` Composables (from Story 3.2) should adapt gracefully to these varying column counts, maintaining visual appeal (e.g., aspect ratio, content scale).
* Test the layout on phone (portrait/landscape), foldable (simulating inner/outer displays if possible with emulator configurations), and tablet emulators/devices.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: `SearchResultsScreen` displays 2 columns in the `LazyVerticalGrid` when `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Compact`.
* AC2: `SearchResultsScreen` displays 3 columns in the `LazyVerticalGrid` when `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Medium`.
* AC3: `SearchResultsScreen` displays 4 columns in the `LazyVerticalGrid` when `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Expanded`.
* AC4: `ImageItem`s within the grid maintain appropriate spacing and visual appeal (e.g., images are cropped or scaled correctly) across different column counts.
* AC5: The performance of the `LazyVerticalGrid` remains smooth during scrolling and when adapting to dynamic column counts after a configuration change.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 7.1 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt` (if adjustments are needed for its `Modifier` to work well with adaptive columns, though ideally its internal logic is already robust).
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` for `ui/results/`. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [201, 202, 205] for grid adaptation.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `LazyVerticalGrid`, `GridCells.Fixed()`, `WindowSizeClass`, `WindowWidthSizeClass`.
    * Conditional logic (`when` expression).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1 for WindowSizeClass library. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for adaptive design section.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * `WindowSizeClass` object.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * The column count logic should be clean and directly driven by `widthSizeClass`.
    * Ensure `ImageItem` uses `Modifier.fillMaxWidth()` within its grid cell to adapt to column width changes.
    * Test on various device configurations using Compose Previews and emulators.
    * Adhere to guidelines in `docs/coding-standards.md` (v1.1) section "Adaptive Design with WindowSizeClasses".
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Modify `SearchResultsScreen.kt`:
    * [ ] Ensure it receives `windowSizeClass: WindowSizeClass` as a parameter (or accesses it via `CompositionLocal`).
    * [ ] Determine `columnCount` based on `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass`:
      ```kotlin
      val columnCount = when (windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass) {
          WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact -> 2
          WindowWidthSizeClass.Medium -> 3
          WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded -> 4 // Or 5, decide based on visual testing
          else -> 2 // Default fallback
      }
      ```
    * [ ] Use this `columnCount` in `LazyVerticalGrid`: `columns = GridCells.Fixed(columnCount)`.
    * [ ] Review `ImageItem` usage: ensure its modifiers allow it to correctly fill the width of the new column size and maintain its aspect ratio or desired appearance (e.g., `Modifier.fillMaxWidth().aspectRatio(1f)` if square items are desired, or adjust as needed). Coil's `ContentScale.Crop` in `ImageItem` will be important here.
* [ ] Test the `SearchResultsScreen` on different emulators/devices or using resizable emulators / Compose Previews with varying `widthSizeClass` values:
    * Phone Portrait (Compact width)
    * Phone Landscape (Medium or Compact width, depends on device)
    * Tablet Portrait (Medium width)
    * Tablet Landscape (Expanded width)
* [ ] Verify visual appeal, spacing, and performance for each configuration.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not primary for this UI adaptation logic directly within Composable, unless helper functions for column calculation become complex.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later) Create tests that provide different `WindowSizeClass` values to `SearchResultsScreen` (may require test utilities or specific test rule to control this).
    * Assert the number of columns rendered by `LazyVerticalGrid` matches expectations.
    * Verify items are displayed.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 for UI test considerations for adaptive layouts.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Run on a phone emulator in portrait. Verify 2 columns.
    * AC2: Rotate phone emulator to landscape (if it becomes Medium width) or run on a small tablet/foldable in portrait. Verify 3 columns.
    * AC3: Run on a tablet emulator in landscape. Verify 4 (or 5) columns.
    * AC4: Visually inspect image items in each configuration. They should fill their respective column widths, images should be scaled/cropped nicely, and spacing should look good.
    * AC5: Scroll the grid in each configuration. Verify smooth performance. Change orientation while results are displayed; verify the grid re-adapts smoothly.
