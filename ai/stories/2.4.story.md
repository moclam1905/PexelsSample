# Story 2.4: Basic Search State Indication (Loading)

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a basic loading indicator after I initiate a search, so that I know the application is processing my request.

**Context:** This story enhances the user experience of the search feature (Story 2.1-2.3) by providing visual feedback during the API call. It involves managing a loading state in the `SearchViewModel` and reflecting this state in the `HomeScreen` UI.

## Detailed Requirements

* The `SearchViewModel` should expose an observable boolean state representing loading status (e.g., `isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean>`).
* This state should be set to `true` before the API call (in `onSearchClicked`) is made and `false` after the call completes (either successfully or with an error).
* The `HomeScreen` UI should observe this loading state.
* When `isLoading` is `true`, the UI should display a simple loading indicator (e.g., a `CircularProgressIndicator` Composable).
* The search input field (`TextField`) and/or search button might be disabled while `isLoading` is `true` to prevent multiple submissions.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: `SearchViewModel` exposes an `isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean>` (defaulting to `false`).
-   AC2: `isLoading` state in `SearchViewModel` is set to `true` just before the `searchPhotos` API call in `onSearchClicked` and set back to `false` in a `finally` block or after both success/error handling of the API call.
-   AC3: `HomeScreen` observes `isLoading` state from `SearchViewModel`. When `true`, a `CircularProgressIndicator` is displayed prominently on the screen. When `false`, the indicator is not visible.
-   AC4: The `OutlinedTextField` and search `Button`/`IconButton` on `HomeScreen` are disabled (e.g., `enabled = !isLoadingValue`) when `isLoading` state is `true`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes completion of Story 2.3.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt`
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` for locations. `docs/coding-standards.md` for state management.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack ViewModel, `StateFlow`, `MutableStateFlow`.
    -   Jetpack Compose (`CircularProgressIndicator`, `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, conditional UI rendering).
    -   Kotlin Coroutines (`viewModelScope`, `finally` block for state reset).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/tech-stack.md`. `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose best practices and state handling.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   No new API interactions, but this story modifies the existing API call flow in `SearchViewModel`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `MutableStateFlow<Boolean>` for `_isLoading` in `SearchViewModel`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Loading state should robustly reset to `false` even if API call fails (use `finally` in `try-catch-finally`).
    -   Loading indicator should be clear and not obstruct other essential UI if possible, or overlay appropriately.
    -   Disabling input controls during loading is good practice to prevent duplicate actions.
    -   Follow state exposure patterns from `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    -   [x] Define `private val _isLoading = MutableStateFlow(false)`.
    -   [x] Define `val isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isLoading.asStateFlow()`.
    -   [x] In `onSearchClicked()` method, within `viewModelScope.launch`:
        -   [x] Set `_isLoading.value = true` before the `try` block for the API call.
        -   [x] Add a `finally` block after `try-catch` and set `_isLoading.value = false` inside it.
-   [x] Modify `HomeScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] Collect the `isLoading` state: `val isLoadingValue by viewModel.isLoading.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
    -   [x] Conditionally display a `CircularProgressIndicator` if `isLoadingValue` is `true`.
        ```kotlin
        // Example:
        // if (isLoadingValue) {
        //     Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
        //         CircularProgressIndicator()
        //     }
        // }
        // The actual UI for displaying results (Epic 3) will need to consider this loading state too.
        // For now, the indicator can overlay or be shown in a dedicated space.
        ```
    -   [x] Update the `enabled` property of `OutlinedTextField` and the search `Button`/`IconButton` to be `!isLoadingValue`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   [x] Mock `PexelsApiService`.
    -   [x] Test that `isLoading` is set to `true` before an API call and `false` after it completes successfully (use Turbine to observe `isLoading` flow).
    -   [x] Test that `isLoading` is set to `true` before an API call and `false` after it fails (mock API to throw error/return error response).
    -   [x] _(Use JUnit 4, MockK, Turbine, Kotlin Coroutines Test as per `docs/testing-strategy.md`)_
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written more formally later) For manual verification:
    -   Trigger a search. Verify `CircularProgressIndicator` appears.
    -   Verify input field and search button are disabled during loading.
    -   Once API call finishes (success/fail), verify indicator disappears and inputs are re-enabled.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1, AC2: Review `SearchViewModel.kt` code for `isLoading` state management.
    -   AC3: Run app. Initiate a search.
        -   Observe that a `CircularProgressIndicator` appears while the (potentially quick on good network) API call is in progress.
        -   Observe that it disappears after the call (check Logcat for API response/error from Story 2.3 to correlate).
    -   AC4: While the `CircularProgressIndicator` is visible, try to type in the `TextField` or click the search button. Verify they are disabled. Verify they become enabled after loading finishes.
    -   *(To make loading more observable for manual testing, one might temporarily add a `delay(2000)` in the ViewModel's API call coroutine, before or after the actual call, but ensure to remove it afterwards).*
