# Story 8.2: Define and Implement Refresh Logic

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define and implement the specific data fetching logic that occurs when a pull-to-refresh is triggered, so that the user receives relevant updated content.

**Context:** This story builds on Story 8.1, where the pull-to-refresh gesture was linked to `SearchViewModel`. Now, the `onRefreshTriggered` method in `SearchViewModel` will be fully implemented to fetch data from the `ImageRepository` and update the UI state accordingly. This implements PRD v1.1 requirement [316].

## Detailed Requirements

* In `SearchViewModel`, the `onRefreshTriggered` function (or the logic it triggers) will:
    * Set `_isRefreshing.value = true`.
    * Clear any existing error states (`_errorState.value = null`).
    * Determine context:
        * If a current search query exists (`_searchQuery.value.isNotBlank()`), re-fetch page 1 for that query.
        * If no current search query (e.g., if the app could show curated photos by default, though current MVP flow is search-first), re-fetch page 1 of curated photos. *Decision: For PexelsSample, refresh will always apply to the current search query if one exists; otherwise, if the result screen can be shown without a query (e.g. curated photos were loaded initially), it refreshes curated. Assume current flow: refresh applies to the current query or re-fetches initial curated if that was the state.* For now, let's simplify: if a search query is active, refresh that. If not, and curated can be displayed, refresh curated. PexelsSample primarily focuses on search, so refresh will predominantly re-run the current search for page 1.
* Call the appropriate `ImageRepository` method (e.g., `searchPhotos(query, page=1, perPage=ITEMS_PER_PAGE)` using the current query, or `getCuratedPhotos(page=1, perPage=ITEMS_PER_PAGE)` if implementing a curated view refresh).
* Upon successful completion:
    * Replace the existing items in `_photos.value` with the new first-page results.
    * Reset `currentPage = 1` and update `totalResults` and `_canLoadMore.value` based on the new response.
* Upon error:
    * Set `_errorState.value` with an appropriate `UserFacingError`.
* In all cases (success or error), set `_isRefreshing.value = false` in a `finally` block.
* Ensure that multiple refresh requests are handled gracefully (e.g., the `_isRefreshing` flag should prevent concurrent refreshes initiated by this mechanism).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When pull-to-refresh is triggered with an active search query, `SearchViewModel.onRefreshTriggered()` calls `imageRepository.searchPhotos()` with the current query, `page = 1`, and `ITEMS_PER_PAGE`.
* AC2: (If a "curated view" is implemented as a refreshable state) If no active search query is present and curated photos are being shown, `onRefreshTriggered()` calls `imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos()` for page 1.
* AC3: `SearchViewModel.isRefreshing` state is true during the data fetch operation and set to false upon completion (success or error).
* AC4: Upon successful refresh, `_photos.value` is updated with the new page 1 results, `currentPage` is reset to 1, and `canLoadMore` and `totalResults` are updated.
* AC5: If the refresh operation fails (API error or network error), `_errorState.value` is set appropriately, and `isRefreshing` is false.
* AC6: `onRefreshTriggered` does nothing if `isRefreshing.value` is already true.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 8.1 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [217-220] on refresh logic.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * `SearchViewModel`, Kotlin Coroutines (`viewModelScope`, `launch`), `StateFlow`.
    * `ImageRepository` (interface and implementation).
    * Error handling (`try-catch`, mapping to `UserFacingError`).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Calls `imageRepository.searchPhotos()` or `imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos()`. These methods internally call `PexelsApiService`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for API endpoints.)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Existing ViewModel states: `_isRefreshing`, `_photos`, `_errorState`, `_searchQuery`, `currentPage`, `totalResults`, `_canLoadMore`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Refresh logic should be encapsulated within `SearchViewModel`.
    * Ensure robust error handling for the refresh operation.
    * Reset pagination state correctly.
    * Use `viewModelScope.launch` for the asynchronous refresh operation.
    * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    * [ ] Enhance `onRefreshTriggered()`:
        * Add guard: `if (_isRefreshing.value) return`.
        * Set `_isRefreshing.value = true`.
        * Set `_errorState.value = null`.
        * Launch `viewModelScope.launch { ... }`.
        * Inside the coroutine:
            * Use a `try-catch-finally` block.
            * **Determine action based on `_searchQuery.value`:**
                * If `_searchQuery.value.isNotBlank()`:
                    * Call `val response = imageRepository.searchPhotos(query = _searchQuery.value, page = 1, perPage = ITEMS_PER_PAGE)`.
                    * Handle `ResultWrapper` (Success/Error) from repository.
                * Else (if supporting curated view refresh):
                    * Call `val response = imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos(page = 1, perPage = ITEMS_PER_PAGE)`.
                    * Handle `ResultWrapper`.
                * *(Focus on search query refresh first as it's the primary mode)*.
            * **On Success (`ResultWrapper.Success`):**
                * `currentPage = 1`.
                * `_photos.value = mappedResultsFromResponseData`.
                * `this.totalResults = responseData.totalResults`.
                * `_canLoadMore.value = (_photos.value.size < this.totalResults) && responseData.nextPage != null` (or similar logic).
            * **On Error (`ResultWrapper.GenericError`, `ResultWrapper.NetworkError`):**
                * Map repository error to `UserFacingError` and set `_errorState.value`.
                * E.g., `_errorState.value = UserFacingError(message = "Refresh failed. Please try again.", isRetryable = true)`.
            * **In `finally` block:**
                * `_isRefreshing.value = false`.
    * [ ] Ensure `ImageRepository` methods (`searchPhotos`, `getCuratedPhotos`) return a `ResultWrapper` or similar structure that allows distinguishing success from specific errors (as per `docs/coding-standards.md` Error Handling Strategy), if not already done in MVP.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    * Mock `ImageRepository`.
    * Test `onRefreshTriggered()`:
        * Verify it calls `imageRepository.searchPhotos(page=1)` when a query exists.
        * Verify it calls `imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos(page=1)` if no query and curated refresh is supported.
        * Verify `isRefreshing` is true during the call, false after (success/error).
        * Verify `photos` list is replaced, `currentPage` is 1, and `canLoadMore`/`totalResults` are updated on successful refresh.
        * Verify `errorState` is set on repository error during refresh.
        * Verify it does nothing if `isRefreshing` is already true.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * (As part of existing Repository tests with MockWebServer) Ensure repository methods for page 1 behave as expected.
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1, AC2: Perform a search. Trigger pull-to-refresh. Use Logcat/debugger to verify the correct repository method is called with `page = 1` and the current query.
    * AC3: Observe the refresh indicator and ViewModel state to confirm `isRefreshing` is true during the operation and false afterwards.
    * AC4: Upon successful refresh, verify the displayed image list updates to show the (potentially new) first page of results. Verify pagination would then continue correctly from this new page 1.
    * AC5: Simulate a network error (e.g., airplane mode) or an API error (if possible with MockWebServer or by temporarily modifying API key for auth error). Trigger refresh. Verify an error message is shown and the refresh indicator stops.
    * AC6: Try to trigger refresh multiple times quickly. Verify only one refresh operation proceeds.
