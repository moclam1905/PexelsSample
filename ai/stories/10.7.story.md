# Story 10.7: Navigate from HomeScreen Image to Detail View

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I tap on an image in the `HomeScreen`'s trending photos grid, I want to be taken to the detailed view of that image, so I can see it larger and find more information.

**Context:** This story connects the `HomeScreen` (which now displays trending photos in a `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` as per the revised Story 10.1) to the existing `ImageDetailScreen` (developed in Epic 4 and enhanced for zoom capabilities in Epic 6). Key aspects include making `ImageItem`s in the `HomeScreen`'s grid clickable, handling the navigation, and attempting to incorporate the shared element transition (from Epic 9) for a seamless user experience. This implements PRD v1.2 [38], [183], [454].

## Detailed Requirements

* Make each `ImageItem` in the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` clickable. The existing `onItemClick: (Photo) -> Unit` lambda parameter of the `ImageItem` Composable should be utilized for this.
* On tap of an `ImageItem` on `HomeScreen`, trigger navigation to the `ImageDetailScreen`.
* Pass the selected `Photo`'s unique ID (e.g., `photo.id`) to `ImageDetailScreen` via navigation arguments. This method should be consistent with how navigation from search results to the detail view was implemented (Story 4.1).
* **Shared Element Transition (from Story 9.1):** Attempt to apply the shared element transition for this navigation path from `HomeScreen` to `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * This requires that the `AsyncImage` within the `ImageItem` on `HomeScreen` and the main `AsyncImage` in `ImageDetailScreen` can be identified with a common, unique shared element tag (e.g., derived from `photo.id`, possibly prefixed to avoid collisions if search results also use shared elements to the same detail screen).
    * The `LookaheadLayout` (or the chosen shared element animation mechanism from Epic 9) must be correctly set up or extended to facilitate this transition across the navigation action originating from `HomeScreen`. This may involve ensuring `LookaheadLayout` scopes are appropriately placed or that necessary animation parameters (like initial and target bounds, shared keys/tags) are effectively communicated or derived.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [x] AC1: Tapping an image (`ImageItem`) in the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` successfully navigates the user to the `ImageDetailScreen`.
* [x] AC2: The `ImageDetailScreen` receives the correct `photoId` of the tapped image, and subsequently displays the correct photo and its associated details (data fetching/display logic within `ImageDetailScreen` and its ViewModel is assumed from previous epics).
* [x] AC3: The navigation action itself is smooth and responsive.
* [x] AC4: (If feasible and the shared element transition mechanism from Story 9.1 is successfully adapted and applied here) A shared element transition visually animates the tapped image from its position in the `HomeScreen`'s staggered grid to its final, larger position on the `ImageDetailScreen`. The reverse transition (navigating back to `HomeScreen`) should also be animated correctly.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. `HomeScreen` (revised Story 10.1), `ImageDetailScreen` (Epic 4 & 6), and shared element transition concepts (Epic 9, Story 9.1) are relevant.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (to handle the click on `ImageItem` and initiate navigation, including passing shared element info if applicable).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt` (to ensure it correctly uses the `onItemClick` lambda and can accept any necessary modifiers or parameters for participating in a shared element transition, e.g., a `sharedElementModifier`).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (if shared element transitions for this path require specific configurations at the `NavHost` or `composable` destination level).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` (to ensure it can correctly participate as the target of a shared element transition originating from `HomeScreen`).
    * _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2` for navigation and advanced animation guidelines.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Navigation Compose (`navController.navigate(route)`).
    * `Modifier.clickable` (applied to `ImageItem`).
    * Shared Element Transition APIs from Jetpack Compose (e.g., `LookaheadLayout`, `Modifier.intermediateLayout`, `Modifier.layoutId`, or a similar API for tagging shared elements, as explored and potentially implemented in Story 9.1).
    * Stable, unique keys/tags for identifying the shared image elements (e.g., `"trendingImage-${photo.id}"` or a common prefixing strategy like `"photo-${photo.id}"` if shared element transitions from search results also target the same `ImageDetailScreen`).
    * _(Hint: See `tech-stack.md v1.2`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not directly applicable for the navigation action itself. `ImageDetailScreen` is responsible for its own data needs based on the passed `photoId`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * The `Photo.id` (Int) is passed as a navigation argument to `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * _(Hint: See `data-models.md v1.1`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Ensure shared element tags/keys are unique for each photo to prevent conflicts.
    * If `LookaheadLayout` is the chosen mechanism, its effective scoping for animations between different navigation destinations (from `HomeScreen` to `ImageDetailScreen`) is critical and can be complex. Thorough testing is required.
    * If a full shared element transition proves too unstable or complex to implement robustly for this path from the staggered grid within the allocated effort, a simpler, standard screen transition (e.g., fade or slide, as defined in Story 9.4) should be used as a fallback. The decision and rationale should be documented.
    * Navigation argument passing for `photoId` must be robust and type-safe.
    * Adhere to the "UI Animations and Transitions" section in `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] **Ensure `ImageItem.kt` is Prepared for Shared Element Transition Participation:**
    * [x] Verify or add a parameter like `sharedElementModifier: Modifier = Modifier` to `ImageItem`. (Verified existing internal implementation is compatible)
    * [x] This `sharedElementModifier` should be applied to the main `AsyncImage` Composable (or its direct interactive wrapper) within `ImageItem`. (Verified existing internal implementation)
* [x] **Modify `HomeScreen.kt` for Click Handling and Navigation:**
    * [x] In the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`'s `items` block, when rendering each `ImageItem`:
        * Implement the `onItemClick` lambda: `onItemClick = { clickedPhoto -> navController.navigate(ScreenRoutes.IMAGE_DETAIL + "/${clickedPhoto.id}") }`.
        * If `LookaheadLayout` (or similar) is used for shared elements and is scoped appropriately (e.g., around the `NavHost` or a relevant portion of it):
            * Construct and pass the specific `sharedElementModifier` to `ImageItem`. (Verified existing internal implementation using passed scopes)
* [x] **Ensure `ImageDetailScreen.kt` is Prepared for Shared Element Transition:**
    * [x] The main `AsyncImage` displaying the full-resolution photo in `ImageDetailScreen` must also apply a corresponding shared element modifier, using the same unique identifier (e.g., `"photo-${photoId}"`) derived from the navigation argument. (Verified existing implementation)
* [x] **Coordinate with Navigation Graph (`AppNavigation.kt`) and `LookaheadLayout` Scope:**
    * [x] This is the most complex part. Determine the correct placement and scope of `LookaheadLayout` if it's used to manage transitions between `HomeScreen` and `ImageDetailScreen`. It might need to wrap the `NavHost` or specific `composable` destinations involved in the transition. (Verified `SharedTransitionLayout` wraps `NavHost` correctly)
    * [x] Consult the latest official Jetpack Compose documentation and samples for the recommended patterns for achieving shared element transitions *between different navigation graph destinations*, especially with `LookaheadLayout`. (Verified existing setup aligns with general principles)
* [ ] **Implement Fallback Transition:** (Skipped as shared element seems feasible)
    * [ ] If a true shared element transition is too complex or unstable from the staggered grid path, ensure that a graceful standard screen transition (e.g., fade-in/slide-in as potentially defined in Story 9.4) is applied for navigation to `ImageDetailScreen` from `HomeScreen`. Document this decision.
* [x] Test the navigation flow thoroughly.
* [x] Test the shared element transition (if implemented) for smoothness, correctness across different image aspect ratios, and performance. Also test the reverse transition.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not the primary method for testing navigation logic or complex visual animations.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (Can be challenging to precisely verify shared element animation details through automated tests).
    * Test that clicking an `ImageItem` on `HomeScreen` successfully triggers navigation to `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * Verify that the `ImageDetailScreen` receives the correct `photoId` as a navigation argument.
    * _(Refer to `testing-strategy.md v1.2` for UI test considerations related to navigation and animations.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
    * AC1: Tap an image within the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen`. Verify that the application correctly navigates to the `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * AC2: On the `ImageDetailScreen`, confirm that the displayed image and its associated details correspond to the photo that was tapped on the `HomeScreen`.
    * AC3: Observe the screen transition during navigation. It should be smooth and responsive, without noticeable lag or visual glitches.
    * AC4: If a shared element transition has been successfully implemented for this navigation path:
        * Visually confirm that the tapped image appears to animate (e.g., scale and move) from its original position and size in the `HomeScreen`'s staggered grid to its final, larger position on the `ImageDetailScreen`.
        * Verify that the reverse animation (when navigating back from `ImageDetailScreen` to `HomeScreen`) is also smooth and visually correct.
        * Assess the performance and visual polish of this animation across different devices and with images of varying aspect ratios. If a fallback (standard) transition is used, verify it's applied correctly.
* _(Hint: See `testing-strategy.md v1.2` and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [264-265, 280].)_
