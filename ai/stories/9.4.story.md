# Story 9.4: Implement General Screen Transitions (Optional & Subtle)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want general navigation between different major sections or screens of the app to feel smooth and polished with subtle transitions, if not already covered by more specific animations like shared elements.

**Context:** This story focuses on adding default, subtle animations for standard screen transitions managed by Jetpack Navigation Compose, where more specific transitions (like shared element in Story 9.1) are not applied. This contributes to an overall polished feel, as per PRD v1.1 [322] and research [264].

## Detailed Requirements

* In the `NavHost` setup (`core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt`), define default `enterTransition`, `exitTransition`, `popEnterTransition`, and `popExitTransition` for navigation actions between main screens.
    * These transitions will apply to navigations not using custom/shared element transitions.
* Use simple, standard transitions like `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `slideInHorizontally`, `slideOutHorizontally` with appropriate `tween` specifications (e.g., duration 200-300ms).
* These transitions should be globally consistent for standard navigation operations unless overridden by more specific transition needs for a particular destination.
* Shared element transitions (Story 9.1) for image navigation will take precedence and should not conflict.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Standard navigation between screens (e.g., from a hypothetical settings screen back to home, or any navigation not using the shared element image transition) uses defined, subtle default animations (e.g., fade or slight horizontal slide).
* AC2: These default screen transitions are performant (target 60fps) and consistent across the application for applicable navigation actions.
* AC3: Transitions do not make the app feel slow or heavy, and are not distracting.
* AC4: The default transitions do not interfere with or override the shared element transition implemented in Story 9.1.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 9.1 (Shared Element) is key for defining where these defaults *don't* apply.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (where `NavHost` is defined).
    * _(Hint: `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [264] for screen transitions. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for UI Animations.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Navigation Compose: `NavHost` parameters for `enterTransition`, `exitTransition`, `popEnterTransition`, `popExitTransition`.
    * Jetpack Compose Animation: `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `slideInHorizontally`, `slideOutHorizontally`, `tween`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1 and Navigation Compose documentation for transition APIs.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Keep default transitions very simple and subtle. Fades are often safest.
    * Ensure durations are short.
    * Test thoroughly to ensure no conflicts with other custom animations.
    * Navigation Compose allows defining these per-destination or globally on `NavHost`. Global defaults on `NavHost` are simpler if consistent transitions are desired.
    * Adhere to "UI Animations and Transitions" in `docs/coding-standards.md` (v1.1).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] In `AppNavigation.kt`, modify the `NavHost` Composable.
* [ ] Define common transition specifications:
    ```kotlin
    // val defaultEnterTransition = fadeIn(animationSpec = tween(300)) + slideInHorizontally(initialOffsetX = { it / 10 }, animationSpec = tween(300))
    // val defaultExitTransition = fadeOut(animationSpec = tween(300)) + slideOutHorizontally(targetOffsetX = { -it / 10 }, animationSpec = tween(300))
    // val defaultPopEnterTransition = fadeIn(animationSpec = tween(300)) + slideInHorizontally(initialOffsetX = { -it / 10 }, animationSpec = tween(300))
    // val defaultPopExitTransition = fadeOut(animationSpec = tween(300)) + slideOutHorizontally(targetOffsetX = { it / 10 }, animationSpec = tween(300))
    // Simpler variant for subtle fade:
    val subtleFadeEnter = fadeIn(animationSpec = tween(durationMillis = 250))
    val subtleFadeExit = fadeOut(animationSpec = tween(durationMillis = 200))
    ```
* [ ] Apply these to the `NavHost` globally or to individual `composable` destinations as needed. For global defaults:
    ```kotlin
    NavHost(
        navController = navController,
        startDestination = ScreenRoutes.HOME, // Or AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen route
        enterTransition = { subtleFadeEnter },
        exitTransition = { subtleFadeExit },
        popEnterTransition = { subtleFadeEnter }, // Often same as enter or specific popEnter
        popExitTransition = { subtleFadeExit }  // Often same as exit or specific popExit
    ) {
        // composable(route = ScreenRoutes.ADAPTIVE_SEARCH_RESULTS_HOST) { ... }
        // composable(route = ScreenRoutes.IMAGE_DETAIL + "/{...}") {
        // This destination might have its own specific transitions if shared element is handled at nav level,
        // or its transitions might be disabled here if LookaheadLayout handles it internally.
        // If LookaheadLayout handles the shared element fully *within* the screen composables,
        // these NavHost transitions might still apply for the overall screen container.
        // }
        // Add a dummy/settings screen if one doesn't exist to test generic transitions
    }
    ```
* [ ] Test navigation between screens that *do not* involve the shared image element transition (e.g., if there was a settings screen or about screen).
* [ ] Verify that these default transitions do not interfere with the shared element transition from Story 9.1. Often, shared element transitions are defined at a different layer or take precedence. If Navigation Compose's `sharedElementComposable` were used (it's more for Views traditionally), specific handling would be needed. With `LookaheadLayout`, the screen itself might fade/slide while the shared element moves independently.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not applicable for verifying visual animation.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (Very challenging to assert specific NavHost-level animations reliably.) Test focuses on ensuring navigation still works and screens appear/disappear.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
    * AC1: Navigate between screens that are *not* part of the image shared element flow (e.g., if a settings page existed, navigate to it and back). Observe the subtle fade or slide animations.
    * AC2: Check performance during these transitions; they should be smooth.
    * AC3: Ensure transitions are not overly long or distracting.
    * AC4: Perform the shared element image transition (Story 9.1). Verify these default NavHost transitions do not break or negatively interact with the shared element animation. The desired effect is that the shared element animates distinctly, while the rest of the screen content might participate in these simpler fades/slides.
