# Story 3.1: Search Results List/Grid UI Structure

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the images matching my search query displayed in a scrollable list or grid, so that I can quickly browse through them.

**Context:** This story begins the implementation of displaying search results. It leverages the `SearchViewModel` (from Epic 2) which now, after a successful search, should hold the list of photos. This story focuses on creating the UI structure to display these photos. A grid layout is preferred.

## Detailed Requirements

* Create a Composable screen or section (e.g., `SearchResultsScreen` or integrate into `HomeScreen`) to display the image results. For MVP, let's enhance `HomeScreen` to show results directly below the search bar, or navigate to a dedicated `SearchResultsScreen`. Given Story 1.5 created `SearchResultsScreen` as a placeholder, we will use that.
* Use a `LazyVerticalGrid` Composable to efficiently display a potentially large number of image items.
* The `SearchViewModel` (from Epic 2) should expose the list of `Photo` domain model objects (mapped from DTOs in Story 2.3's API call success path) as an observable state.
* The UI (`SearchResultsScreen`) should observe this list and render an `ImageItem` (to be created in Story 3.2) for each photo.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: The `SearchViewModel` is updated to store and expose `StateFlow<List<Photo>>` representing the current search results (initially empty). This list is populated upon successful API response from Story 2.3 (mapping DTOs to `Photo` domain models).
-   AC2: The `SearchResultsScreen` (navigated to from `HomeScreen` after a search is initiated, or `HomeScreen` itself is adapted) uses a `LazyVerticalGrid` to display items.
-   AC3: The `LazyVerticalGrid` observes the list of `Photo` objects from `SearchViewModel` and, for each photo, attempts to render a placeholder for what will become an `ImageItem` (actual `ImageItem` implementation is Story 3.2). For this story, a simple `Text(photo.photographer)` inside a `Box` for each grid cell is sufficient to prove data binding.
-   AC4: The grid is scrollable if the number of items (even placeholders) exceeds the screen height.
-   AC5: Navigation from `HomeScreen` (after search initiation in `SearchViewModel`) to `SearchResultsScreen` is implemented if `SearchResultsScreen` is a separate screen. If results are on `HomeScreen`, this screen updates to show the grid. (Let's assume navigation to `SearchResultsScreen` as per Story 1.5's placeholder).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Epics 1 & 2 are complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt` (from Story 1.5 placeholder)
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (if `SearchResultsScreen` needs arguments or if navigation trigger changes).
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (to trigger navigation to `SearchResultsScreen` on successful search).
    -   Files to Create: None for this specific story (ImageItem is next).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose & ViewModel best practices.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Compose (`LazyVerticalGrid`, `GridCells.Fixed` or `GridCells.Adaptive`, `Box`, `Text`).
    -   `SearchViewModel` (`StateFlow<List<Photo>>`).
    -   Kotlin Coroutines & Flow (for collecting state).
    -   Hilt (`hiltViewModel()` for `SearchViewModel` in `SearchResultsScreen`).
    -   Navigation Component for Compose (to navigate to `SearchResultsScreen`).
    -   `Photo` domain model (from Story 1.4).
    -   Mappers (from Story 1.4, used in `SearchViewModel`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Relies on `SearchViewModel` having successfully fetched and mapped data from Pexels API (Story 2.3).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `SearchViewModel` will now manage `StateFlow<List<Photo>> _photos`.
    -   `SearchResultsScreen` will observe this flow.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for `Photo` structure.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Use `LazyVerticalGrid` for efficient display. Choose a reasonable number of columns (e.g., 2 or 3).
    -   ViewModel exposes `StateFlow<List<Photo>>`.
    -   UI collects state using `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
    -   Follow MVVM and Compose guidelines from `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   If `SearchResultsScreen` is separate, `SearchViewModel` might need to be shared or its data passed appropriately. For MVP, having `SearchResultsScreen` also observe the same `SearchViewModel` instance (scoped to NavGraph or Activity) is a common pattern if search initiation and display are tightly coupled. Alternatively, `SearchViewModel` can expose a one-time event to navigate and pass the initial list, but this story focuses on displaying a reactive list. Let's assume `SearchViewModel` is shared or re-fetched. For simplicity of MVP, let's adapt `SearchViewModel` to be the single source of truth for search actions AND results.
    -   Navigation to `SearchResultsScreen` should happen from `SearchViewModel` or `HomeScreen` when search is successful AND results are available.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    -   [x] Define `private val _photos = MutableStateFlow<List<Photo>>(emptyList())`.
    -   [x] Define `val photos: StateFlow<List<Photo>> = _photos.asStateFlow()`.
    -   [x] In `onSearchClicked()`'s success block (after API call in Story 2.3):
        -   [x] Map the `response.body()!!.photos` (list of `PexelsPhotoDto`) to `List<Photo>` using mappers from Story 1.4.
        -   [x] Update `_photos.value` with the mapped list.
        -   [x] (Consider clearing `_photos.value` when a new search starts, before `_isLoading.value = true`).
-   [x] Modify `HomeScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] After calling `viewModel.onSearchClicked()`, observe a new state from `SearchViewModel` or a trigger that indicates a search has successfully returned data and navigation should occur.
    -   [x] Navigate to `ScreenRoutes.SEARCH_RESULTS` when appropriate (e.g., upon successful data fetch).
        *Alternative: If results are displayed directly on `HomeScreen`, then `HomeScreen` itself would contain the `LazyVerticalGrid` and observe `viewModel.photos`.* *Decision: Proceed with separate `SearchResultsScreen` as per initial plan.*
-   [x] Modify `SearchResultsScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] Inject `SearchViewModel`: `val viewModel: SearchViewModel = hiltViewModel()`.
    -   [x] Collect photos: `val photoList by viewModel.photos.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
    -   [x] Implement a `LazyVerticalGrid`:
        -   [x] E.g., `columns = GridCells.Fixed(2)` or `GridCells.Adaptive(minSize = 128.dp)`.
        -   [x] Provide `contentPadding`.
        -   [x] In `items(photoList, key = { photo -> photo.id }) { photo -> ... }`:
            -   [x] Render a placeholder for now: `Box(modifier = Modifier.aspectRatio(1f).padding(4.dp).background(Color.LightGray)) { Text(photo.photographer, modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)) }`.
-   [x] Ensure navigation path is clear: `HomeScreen` (input) -> `SearchViewModel` processes search -> If success, `SearchViewModel` updates `photos` list -> `HomeScreen` triggers navigation to `SearchResultsScreen` -> `SearchResultsScreen` observes `photos` from the (potentially shared or re-fetched) `SearchViewModel` and displays them.
    *To simplify ViewModel sharing for MVP, `SearchViewModel` can be scoped to the navigation graph that includes both `HomeScreen` and `SearchResultsScreen` or be an activity-scoped ViewModel.*
    *For initial implementation: allow `SearchResultsScreen` to get its own instance of `SearchViewModel`. The state (`photos`) would implicitly be for the *last successful search performed by any instance of this VM type if not properly scoped*. This will be refined by state persistence or proper scoping if it becomes an issue. For this story, focus on display from *a* populated VM.*

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   Verify that on successful API call, `_photos` state is updated with a list of mapped `Photo` domain models. (Mock `PexelsApiService` and mappers). Use Turbine.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later) Verify `LazyVerticalGrid` displays the correct number of placeholder items based on ViewModel state.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Review `SearchViewModel.kt` code.
    -   AC2: Run the app. Perform a search (e.g., "dogs") on `HomeScreen`.
    -   AC5: Verify navigation to `SearchResultsScreen` occurs after the search loading (from Story 2.4) completes and if data is fetched.
    -   AC3: On `SearchResultsScreen`, verify that a grid of placeholders (Boxes with photographer names) is displayed, corresponding to the fetched photos.
    -   AC4: If many photos are fetched (e.g., increase `perPage` in `SearchViewModel` temporarily for testing), verify the grid is scrollable.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for testing approaches.)_
