# Story 10.6: Robust State Handling for HomeScreen (Initial Load, Empty, Error)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the `HomeScreen` (displaying trending photos) to clearly communicate its status, whether it's loading initial photos, encounters an error, or if (hypothetically) no trending photos are available.

**Context:** This story ensures the `HomeScreen` gracefully handles all its primary data states for the trending photos feed: initial data loading, displaying the photo grid (content state), an empty state (if no photos are returned by `/v1/curated`), and error states (network/API issues during the initial load of trending photos). It builds upon Story 10.1 (basic `HomeScreen` structure with initial loading) and will reuse the `ErrorView` Composable from Epic 5. This aligns with PRD v1.2 [45], [90], [190], [210], [235], [460]-[461], [481], [506] and research [State Management section].

## Detailed Requirements

* `HomeScreenViewModel` will manage and expose a comprehensive UI state for the trending photos feed, ideally using a sealed interface like `HomeScreenUiState` (e.g., `InitialLoading`, `Content(List<Photo>)`, `Error(UserFacingError)`, `Empty`). This state will cover:
  * `isLoadingInitial: Boolean` (represented by `HomeScreenUiState.InitialLoading`).
  * `photos: List<Photo>` (contained within `HomeScreenUiState.Content`).
  * `isEmpty: Boolean` (represented by `HomeScreenUiState.Empty`, which is true if `!isLoadingInitial`, `photos.isEmpty()`, no `error`, and an initial fetch *was* attempted).
  * `error: UserFacingError?` (contained within `HomeScreenUiState.Error`, for initial load errors).
* **Initial Load State on `HomeScreen`:** When `HomeScreenViewModel.uiState` is `InitialLoading` (and the `photos` list within a previous `Content` state is empty, or no content has been loaded yet):
  * `HomeScreen` displays a prominent, screen-centered `CircularProgressIndicator` OR a full-screen shimmer placeholder applied to a skeleton grid structure (aligning with Story 10.5's shimmer effect for a polished loading visual).
* **Empty State on `HomeScreen`:** If the `ImageRepository` successfully returns an empty list for the initial `/v1/curated` photos fetch (and it's not an error state, and loading is finished):
  * `HomeScreenViewModel` transitions its `uiState` to `Empty`.
  * `HomeScreen` displays a user-friendly message (e.g., "No trending photos to show right now. Try refreshing!"). The photo grid area should be hidden or replaced by this message.
* **Error State on `HomeScreen`:** If the initial fetch for trending photos from `ImageRepository` results in an error:
  * `HomeScreenViewModel.uiState` transitions to `Error(UserFacingError_details)`.
  * `HomeScreen` displays a centered `ErrorView` Composable (reused from Story 5.1) containing the error message and a "Retry" button.
  * The "Retry" button on `ErrorView` calls a function in `HomeScreenViewModel` (e.g., `retryInitialLoad()` or simply `WorkspaceInitialPhotos()` / `onManualRefreshTriggered()`) to re-attempt fetching the initial curated photos.
* Use `AnimatedVisibility` or `Crossfade` (as implemented or refined in Story 9.3) to provide smooth visual transitions between these primary states (Loading, Content, Empty, Error) on the `HomeScreen`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [x] AC1: When `HomeScreenViewModel.uiState` is `InitialLoading` (and no previous content/error is shown), a full-screen loading indicator (e.g., centered `CircularProgressIndicator` or a shimmer skeleton grid) is displayed on `HomeScreen`.
* [x] AC2: If the initial API call for curated photos successfully returns an empty list (and `HomeScreenViewModel.uiState` becomes `Empty`), `HomeScreen` displays a user-friendly "empty state" message. The trending photos grid is hidden.
* [x] AC3: If the initial data fetch for `HomeScreen` fails (and `HomeScreenViewModel.uiState` becomes `Error`), a full-screen `ErrorView` with a descriptive message and a "Retry" button is displayed. The trending grid and empty message are hidden.
* [x] AC4: Clicking the "Retry" button on the `ErrorView` triggers `HomeScreenViewModel` to re-attempt fetching the initial set of curated photos, transitioning the UI appropriately (e.g., back to `InitialLoading`).
* [x] AC5: Transitions between the Loading, Content (photo grid), Empty, and Error states on `HomeScreen` are smooth and clear (e.g., using `Crossfade` or `AnimatedVisibility`). Only one of these primary UI states for the trending photos feed is predominantly visible at any given time.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 10.1 (basic `HomeScreen` structure with initial loading mechanism via `HomeScreenViewModel`) and Story 10.5 (shimmer effect concept) are relevant. The `ErrorView` Composable from Epic 5 (Story 5.1) will be reused. Animation patterns for state transitions from Epic 9 (Story 9.3) should be applied.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreenViewModel.kt`
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt`
  * Files to Create (if using sealed UI state):
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreenUiState.kt`
  * _(Hint: `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md` [State Management section]. `coding-standards.md v1.2`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * `HomeScreenViewModel` state management (`StateFlow`, `UserFacingError`, and a recommended sealed `HomeScreenUiState`).
  * Jetpack Compose: Conditional rendering (`when` block), `CircularProgressIndicator`, `ErrorView` (reusable), `Text` for empty state, `AnimatedVisibility` or `Crossfade` for state transitions.
  * Skeleton loaders / Shimmer effect (from Story 10.5, applied to a placeholder grid during `InitialLoading` state).
  * _(Hint: `tech-stack.md v1.2`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Handles various UI states resulting from the initial `imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos()` call made by `HomeScreenViewModel`.
  * _(Hint: `api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
  * `HomeScreenViewModel` to expose a comprehensive `uiState: StateFlow<HomeScreenUiState>`. The `HomeScreenUiState` sealed interface would have cases like `InitialLoading`, `Content(val photos: List<Photo>)`, `Error(val errorDetails: UserFacingError)`, and `Empty`.
  * _(Hint: See `data-models.md v1.1`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
  * Not applicable.
  * _(Hint: See `environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The `HomeScreenUiState` sealed interface in `HomeScreenViewModel` is the preferred pattern for representing mutually exclusive UI states clearly.
  * `HomeScreen.kt` should reactively display UI based on observing this single `uiState`.
  * The "Retry" logic in the ViewModel should correctly re-initiate the initial load sequence for trending photos.
  * Animations between states should be consistent with those defined in Story 9.3, making UI transitions feel natural.
  * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] **Define/Refine `HomeScreenUiState.kt` (if not already done or needs adjustment):**
    ```kotlin
    // package com.nguyenmoclam.pexelssample.ui.home // Or ui.model
    // import com.nguyenmoclam.pexelssample.domain.model.Photo
    // import com.nguyenmoclam.pexelssample.ui.model.UserFacingError
    
    // sealed interface HomeScreenUiState {
    //     data object InitialLoading : HomeScreenUiState
    //     data class Content(val photos: List<Photo>) : HomeScreenUiState
    //     data class Error(val errorDetails: UserFacingError) : HomeScreenUiState
    //     data object Empty : HomeScreenUiState
    // }
    ```
* [x] **Update `HomeScreenViewModel.kt` to use and manage `HomeScreenUiState`:**
  * [x] Change state exposure from individual `StateFlow`s (for `isLoadingInitial`, `photos`, `errorState` related to trending photos) to a single `private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow<HomeScreenUiState>(HomeScreenUiState.InitialLoading)` and `val uiState: StateFlow<HomeScreenUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()`.
  * [x] Modify `WorkspaceInitialPhotos()` (and any retry methods like `onManualRefreshTriggered` if they also handle full state reset):
    * At the start: `_uiState.value = HomeScreenUiState.InitialLoading`.
    * On successful API response (`ResultWrapper.Success<PexelsSearchResponseDto>` from repository):
      * Map DTOs to `List<Photo>`.
      * If `mappedPhotos.isNotEmpty()`: `_uiState.value = HomeScreenUiState.Content(mappedPhotos)`. (Also update pagination states like `currentCuratedPage=1`, `_canLoadMoreCurated`).
      * If `mappedPhotos.isEmpty()`: `_uiState.value = HomeScreenUiState.Empty`.
    * On API error (`ResultWrapper.GenericError` or `ResultWrapper.NetworkError` from repository):
      * `_uiState.value = HomeScreenUiState.Error(UserFacingError(message = "Failed to load trending photos. ${error.message ?: "Please try again."}", isRetryable = true))`.
  * [x] Ensure `isLoadingNextPage` and `paginationError` remain separate states if they only apply to pagination actions and not the overall screen state for initial load.
* [x] **Modify `HomeScreen.kt` to Render Based on `HomeScreenUiState`:**
  * [x] Collect `val currentUiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
  * [x] Use a `Crossfade` (or `AnimatedVisibility` with careful management) to switch the main content area:
    ```kotlin
    // Crossfade(targetState = currentUiState, animationSpec = tween(300), label = "HomeScreenContentSwitch") { state ->
    //    when (state) {
    //        HomeScreenUiState.InitialLoading -> {
    //            // CenteredCircularProgressIndicator() OR ShimmerGridPlaceholderComposable()
    //        }
    //        is HomeScreenUiState.Content -> {
    //            LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid(photos = state.photos, ..., gridState = gridState)
    //            // Include logic for pagination indicator based on viewModel.isLoadingNextPage and viewModel.paginationError here if grid is visible
    //        }
    //        HomeScreenUiState.Empty -> {
    //            CenteredMessageComposable(message = "No trending photos to show right now. Try refreshing!")
    //        }
    //        is HomeScreenUiState.Error -> {
    //            ErrorView(
    //                error = state.errorDetails,
    //                onRetry = { viewModel.fetchInitialPhotos() } // Or onManualRefreshTriggered
    //            )
    //        }
    //    }
    // }
    ```
  * [x] Implement `ShimmerGridPlaceholderComposable()` for the `InitialLoading` state, using shimmer elements arranged like the staggered grid. (Used `CircularProgressIndicator` as per AC1 allowance, shimmer is a separate enhancement)
  * [x] Implement `CenteredMessageComposable(message: String)` for the `Empty` state.
* [x] Apply consistent animations (from Story 9.3, e.g., `fadeIn` + `slideInVertically`) to the `AnimatedVisibility` or within `Crossfade` for smoother state transitions. (Used `Crossfade` with `tween(300)` as suggested)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `HomeScreenViewModel.kt`):**
  * Test all defined state transitions for the initial load of trending photos:
    * Default state is `InitialLoading`.
    * `WorkspaceInitialPhotos()`:
      * `InitialLoading` -> `Content(data)` on successful fetch with data.
      * `InitialLoading` -> `Empty` on successful fetch with an empty photo list.
      * `InitialLoading` -> `Error(details)` on repository error.
  * Verify that the `WorkspaceInitialPhotos()` (or a dedicated retry function called by `ErrorView`) correctly re-triggers the loading sequence and can transition to `Content` if the underlying issue causing the error is resolved.
  * Mock `ImageRepository` to return different outcomes (success with data, success with empty list, network error, generic error).
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
  * (To be formalized later)
  * Test `HomeScreen`'s UI reaction to various `HomeScreenUiState` values emitted by a mocked `HomeScreenViewModel`:
    * ViewModel emits `InitialLoading`: Verify the loading indicator or shimmer skeleton placeholder is displayed.
    * ViewModel emits `Content`: Verify the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` with photos is displayed.
    * ViewModel emits `Empty`: Verify the "empty state" message is displayed and the grid is hidden.
    * ViewModel emits `Error`: Verify `ErrorView` is displayed. Test the "Retry" button functionality by having the mock ViewModel transition through `InitialLoading` then to `Content` upon the retry action.
  * Verify smooth animated transitions between these primary states if feasible with the testing framework.
  * _(Refer to `testing-strategy.md v1.2`.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  * AC1: On the very first app launch (or after clearing app data to ensure no cache), verify that the full-screen loading indicator (or a shimmer skeleton grid) is displayed on `HomeScreen` while the initial set of trending photos is being fetched.
  * AC2: (This state might be rare for `/v1/curated` but should be testable if the API could return success with an empty photo list). If the API call for curated photos successfully returns an empty list, verify that `HomeScreen` displays the user-friendly "empty state" message and the grid is not shown.
  * AC3: Simulate an initial load error for trending photos (e.g., by launching the app in airplane mode for the first time or if the API is down). Verify that `ErrorView` (with a relevant message and "Retry" button) is displayed centrally on `HomeScreen`.
  * AC4: While the `ErrorView` is displayed due to a network error, restore network connectivity and click the "Retry" button. Verify that `HomeScreenViewModel` re-attempts the fetch, the UI transitions to the loading state, and then displays the photo grid if the fetch is successful.
  * AC5: Visually confirm that transitions between the Loading state, the Content state (photo grid), the Empty state message, and the Error view state on `HomeScreen` are smooth and clear (e.g., using `Crossfade` or `AnimatedVisibility`). Ensure only one of these states is predominantly visible at a time, without overlap or flickering.
