# Story 6.2: Implement Zoom Level Constraints and Boundary Checks

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when zooming and panning an image, I want the interaction to be constrained within sensible limits, so I don't zoom too far in/out or pan the image completely off-screen.

**Context:** This story builds upon the core pinch-to-zoom and pan functionality implemented in Story 6.1. It focuses on adding essential constraints to the zoom scale and pan offsets to ensure a polished and predictable user experience, as discussed in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [175, 184].

## Detailed Requirements

* Define minimum zoom level: This will typically be the scale at which the image "fits to view" (either by width or height, maintaining aspect ratio, depending on image and screen dimensions). Calculate this initial `fitScale` when the image dimensions (`photo.width`, `photo.height`) and the Composable's layout size are known (e.g., using `Modifier.onSizeChanged` or `BoxWithConstraints`).
* Define maximum zoom level: E.g., `maxScaleFactor = 3f` to `5f` (relative to `fitScale` or an absolute cap like `5f`).
* In the gesture handling logic from Story 6.1, clamp the `currentScale` state between the calculated `minScale` (which is `fitScale`) and `maxScale` (`fitScale * maxScaleFactor` or absolute `maxScale`).
* Implement boundary checks for panning (`offsetX`, `offsetY`):
    * When `offsetX` or `offsetY` are updated, calculate the available "over-pan" space based on the current `scale`, image dimensions, and view dimensions.
    * Prevent `offsetX` and `offsetY` from allowing the image edges to move beyond the view bounds, unless the scaled image dimension is smaller than the view dimension along that axis (in which case, it should center).
* The calculations need to account for the image's aspect ratio and the Composable's layout size. When scale is reset to `fitScale`, `offsetX` and `offsetY` should also reset to `0f`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The image cannot be zoomed out smaller than its calculated "fit-to-view" scale (`minScale`). The initial scale of the image is set to this `fitScale`.
* AC2: The image cannot be zoomed in beyond a predefined maximum magnification factor (e.g., `maxScale = minScale * 3f`).
* AC3: When panning a zoomed-in image, `offsetX` and `offsetY` are clamped so that image edges do not pan beyond the view container's edges. If the scaled image is smaller than the container in a dimension, it centers along that axis.
* AC4: Zoom and pan constraints work correctly for images of various aspect ratios and across different view sizes.
* AC5: When zoom scale is reset or set to `minScale`, `offsetX` and `offsetY` are reset to `0f` (centering the image).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 6.1 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt`
    * _(Hint: Refer to `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [184] for boundary calculation challenges and `docs/coding-standards.md` for gesture handling.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `Modifier.pointerInput`, `Modifier.onSizeChanged` or `BoxWithConstraints` (to get layout size), state management (`remember`, `mutableStateOf`), `LaunchedEffect`.
    * Kotlin `Math.max`, `Math.min`, `coerceIn`.
    * Image and view dimension calculations.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * States: `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`.
    * Local variables for `minScale`, `maxScale`, view dimensions, image dimensions.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for `Photo` dimensions.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Calculations for `minScale` and pan boundaries should be clear and robust.
    * Use `LaunchedEffect` or `derivedStateOf` carefully if calculations depend on multiple changing states or layout properties.
    * Ensure state updates are efficient and trigger minimal necessary recompositions.
    * Code for constraint logic should be well-commented if complex.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] In `ImageDetailScreen.kt`, get the size of the Composable that will contain the image (e.g., using `Modifier.onSizeChanged { layoutSize = it }` or `BoxWithConstraints`). Store this `layoutSize: IntSize`.
* [ ] Calculate `minScale` (fit-to-view scale) once `layoutSize` and `photo` (with its dimensions) are available. This should maintain aspect ratio.
    ```kotlin
    // Simplified example logic, assuming photo is not null
    // val imageWidth = photo.width.toFloat()
    // val imageHeight = photo.height.toFloat()
    // val viewWidth = layoutSize.width.toFloat()
    // val viewHeight = layoutSize.height.toFloat()
    // val scaleX = viewWidth / imageWidth
    // val scaleY = viewHeight / imageHeight
    // val calculatedMinScale = minOf(scaleX, scaleY)
    // minScale = calculatedMinScale // Update state
    // scale = minScale // Set initial scale
    ```
* [ ] Define `maxScaleFactor` (e.g., `3f`) and calculate `maxScale = minScale * maxScaleFactor`.
* [ ] Modify the `scale` update logic in `detectTransformGestures`: `scale = (scale * zoom).coerceIn(minScale, maxScale)`.
* [ ] If `scale` is coerced back to `minScale`, reset `offsetX = 0f` and `offsetY = 0f`.
* [ ] Implement pan boundary clamping logic in `detectTransformGestures` after updating `offsetX` and `offsetY`:
    * Calculate scaled image dimensions: `scaledWidth = imageWidth * scale`, `scaledHeight = imageHeight * scale`.
    * Calculate maximum allowable offsets (available "over-pan"):
        * `maxPanX = if (scaledWidth > viewWidth) (scaledWidth - viewWidth) / 2f else 0f`
        * `maxPanY = if (scaledHeight > viewHeight) (scaledHeight - viewHeight) / 2f else 0f`
    * Clamp offsets: `offsetX = offsetX.coerceIn(-maxPanX, maxPanX)`, `offsetY = offsetY.coerceIn(-maxPanY, maxPanY)`.
    * If scaled dimension is less than view dimension (e.g., `scaledWidth < viewWidth`), ensure `offsetX` is `0f` (center). Same for Y.
* [ ] Initialize `scale` to `minScale` once `minScale` is calculated (e.g., in `LaunchedEffect` depending on `photo` and `layoutSize`).
* [ ] Test thoroughly with different image aspect ratios and view sizes.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * If constraint calculation logic is extracted into helper functions, unit test these with various inputs (image dimensions, view dimensions, current scale/offsets).
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * Simulate pinch gestures to zoom beyond min/max limits and verify scale is clamped.
    * Simulate pan gestures to move image edges beyond view bounds and verify offsets are clamped.
    * Test that resetting zoom also centers the image.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` [Epic 6 points].)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Attempt to zoom out beyond the initial fit-to-view. Verify image doesn't get smaller. Confirm initial display is fit-to-view.
    * AC2: Attempt to zoom in excessively. Verify zoom stops at a reasonable maximum.
    * AC3: Zoom in. Pan the image in all four directions. Verify image edges stop at the view boundaries.
    * AC4: Test with portrait, landscape, and square-ish images. Test on different emulator sizes or by resizing in multi-window if applicable.
    * AC5: After zooming and panning, find a way to reset zoom (e.g., will be easier with double-tap in Story 6.3). Verify `offsetX` and `offsetY` become `0f`.
