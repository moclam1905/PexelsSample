# Story 10.3: Implement Dynamic Column Count for HomeScreen Grid

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the `HomeScreen`'s photo grid to adapt its number of columns based on my device's screen size and orientation, so it always looks well-organized and utilizes space effectively.

**Context:** This story applies the `WindowSizeClass` mechanism (from Epic 7, Story 7.1) to the `HomeScreen`'s `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` (which displays trending photos, as per revised Story 10.1). The number of columns in this grid will adapt dynamically to make optimal use of the available screen width. This addresses PRD v1.2 [40], [185], [456].

## Detailed Requirements

* The `HomeScreen.kt` Composable will consume the `WindowSizeClass` (provided from `MainActivity` or a root Composable, as established in Story 7.1).
* Dynamically set the `columns` parameter of `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` (e.g., using `StaggeredGridCells.Fixed(count)`) based on the `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass`. Consideration for `LocalConfiguration.current.orientation` can also be included for more refined control if `widthSizeClass` alone isn't sufficient for all orientation scenarios.
  * Example target column counts based on `widthSizeClass`:
    * `WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact`: 2 columns.
    * `WindowWidthSizeClass.Medium`: 3 columns.
    * `WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded`: 4 columns.
* Ensure that the `ImageItem` Composables within the grid, and their content (images), adapt well to the varying column widths, leveraging the nature of the staggered grid for variable item heights.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* ✅ AC1: The number of columns in the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` (displaying trending photos) is 2 when `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Compact`.
* ✅ AC2: The number of columns is 3 when `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Medium`.
* ✅ AC3: The number of columns is 4 when `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Expanded`.
* ✅ AC4: The staggered layout of trending photos on `HomeScreen` remains visually appealing, and `ImageItem`s are well-proportioned with different column counts and during orientation changes.
* ✅ AC5: State (scroll position of the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`, loaded items in `HomeScreenViewModel`) is reasonably preserved during column count changes due to configuration updates (e.g., screen rotation).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 10.1 (modified `HomeScreen` with grid) and Story 7.1 (`WindowSizeClass` setup) are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt`
  * _(Hint: `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md` [Section 2]. `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Jetpack Compose: `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`, `StaggeredGridCells.Fixed()`, `WindowSizeClass`, `WindowWidthSizeClass` (from `androidx.compose.material3.windowsizeclass`), `LocalConfiguration`.
  * _(Hint: `tech-stack.md v1.2` confirms usage of `material3-window-size-class`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Not applicable for this story.
  * _(Hint: `api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
  * `WindowSizeClass` object passed to or accessed by `HomeScreen`.
  * _(Hint: See `data-models.md v1.1`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
  * Not applicable.
  * _(Hint: See `environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The logic for determining the column count should be clear and primarily driven by `widthSizeClass`.
  * The staggered nature of the grid handles variable item heights; this story focuses on adapting the number of fixed-width columns.
  * Thoroughly test across various device configurations (phones, tablets, different orientations) using Compose Previews and emulators.
  * Adhere to guidelines in the "Adaptive Design with WindowSizeClasses" section of `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] Modify `HomeScreen.kt`:
  * [x] Ensure `HomeScreen` Composable receives `windowSizeClass: WindowSizeClass` as a parameter (or accesses it via a `CompositionLocal` as set up in Story 7.1).
  * [x] Inside `HomeScreen`, define the `columnCount` for the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` based on `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass`:
    ```kotlin
    // import androidx.compose.material3.windowsizeclass.WindowWidthSizeClass
    // import androidx.compose.ui.platform.LocalConfiguration
    // import android.content.res.Configuration
    
    // val configuration = LocalConfiguration.current // Optional: if orientation is needed beyond width class
    // val isLandscape = configuration.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE
    
    val columnCount = when (windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass) {
        WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact -> 2 
        WindowWidthSizeClass.Medium -> 3
        WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded -> 4 
        else -> 2 // A sensible default
    }
    ```
  * [x] Apply this `columnCount` to the `columns` parameter of `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`: `columns = StaggeredGridCells.Fixed(columnCount)`.
  * [x] Review the `ImageItem` usage within the grid. Ensure its modifiers (e.g., `Modifier.fillMaxWidth()` within its cell context) allow it to adapt to the new column widths correctly. Coil's `ContentScale.Crop` or similar within `ImageItem` will be important for visual consistency.
* [x] Test the `HomeScreen` on different emulators/devices or using resizable emulators / Compose Previews configured for various `widthSizeClass` values (Compact, Medium, Expanded) and orientations.
* [x] Verify visual appeal, item spacing (Story 10.5 may further refine spacing), and performance for each configuration.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
  * Not the primary method for testing this UI adaptation logic if it remains simple conditional logic within the Composable. If the column calculation logic becomes complex and is extracted into a separate helper function, unit test that function with various `WindowSizeClass` inputs.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
  * (To be formalized later)
  * Create tests that can provide different `WindowSizeClass` values to the `HomeScreen` Composable (this might require specific test utilities or a test rule to control the `WindowSizeClass` provided to the Composable under test).
  * Assert that the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` renders with the expected number of columns by querying its layout information or item count per effective row if feasible through the testing API.
  * _(Refer to `testing-strategy.md v1.2` for UI test considerations for adaptive layouts.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  * AC1: Run the app on a standard phone emulator in portrait mode (`Compact` width). Verify the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` displays its trending photos in 2 columns.
  * AC2: Rotate the phone emulator to landscape (if this typically results in `Medium` width for that device profile) or run on a small tablet/foldable emulator in portrait mode (`Medium` width). Verify 3 columns.
  * AC3: Run the app on a tablet emulator in landscape mode (`Expanded` width). Verify 4 columns.
  * AC4: Visually inspect the layout in each configuration. Ensure `ImageItem`s are well-proportioned for the column width and the staggered effect is pleasing. Check item spacing and overall grid aesthetics.
  * AC5: While `HomeScreen` is displaying trending photos, rotate the device. Verify the grid adapts to the new column count smoothly. The scroll position should be reasonably maintained (exact item might shift if item sizes change dramatically, but general viewing area should be preserved), and data should not be unnecessarily re-fetched by `HomeScreenViewModel` solely due to orientation change.
