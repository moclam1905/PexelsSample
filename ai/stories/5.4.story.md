# Story 5.4: UI Polish and Visual Consistency Review

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean, modern, and visually appealing interface that is consistent across all screens.

**Context:** This story focuses on refining the overall look and feel of the application. It involves reviewing all existing UI elements and screens developed in Epics 1-4, ensuring they adhere to Material 3 guidelines, the project's aesthetic goals ("clean, modern, intuitive" from PRD), and basic accessibility considerations.

## Detailed Requirements

* Review all existing screens and UI components (`HomeScreen`, `SearchResultsScreen`, `ImageDetailScreen`, `ImageItem`, `ErrorView`, loading indicators).
* Ensure consistent use of spacing, padding, and margins (e.g., Material Design's 8dp grid).
* Standardize typography (font sizes, weights, styles using `MaterialTheme.typography` from `ui/theme/Typography.kt`).
* Ensure a harmonious color palette (from `ui/theme/Color.kt` and applied via `MaterialTheme` in `ui/theme/Theme.kt`) is used consistently for text, backgrounds, buttons, icons.
* Refine iconography for clarity and visual appeal (using Material Symbols).
* Check for general alignment and visual hierarchy on each screen.
* Ensure touch targets are adequately sized (at least 48dp x 48dp for interactive elements).
* Address any elements that feel cluttered or unrefined.
* Verify basic accessibility standards (e.g., sufficient contrast ratios, content descriptions for images and icon buttons).
* The overall aesthetic should align with "modern Android design" and the "clean, intuitive" vision from the project brief and PRD.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: UI elements across all screens (`HomeScreen`, `SearchResultsScreen`, `ImageDetailScreen`) use consistent spacing, padding, and margins based on Material 3 guidelines (e.g., 8dp grid).
-   AC2: Typography (defined in `ui/theme/Typography.kt` and applied via `MaterialTheme`) is standardized and applied consistently for different text roles (titles, body, captions).
-   AC3: Color usage (from `ui/theme/Color.kt` via `MaterialTheme`) is consistent for primary/secondary actions, backgrounds, surfaces, text, and error states.
-   AC4: Icons (Material Symbols) are clear, well-chosen, consistently styled (e.g., filled vs. outlined), and have content descriptions.
-   AC5: Touch targets for all interactive elements (buttons, clickable items) meet minimum accessibility guidelines (e.g., 48dp x 48dp).
-   AC6: Basic accessibility checks pass: content descriptions are present for images/icons, and text contrast ratios are generally sufficient.
-   AC7: Overall UI feels polished, modern, visually appealing, and intuitive, aligning with the project vision.

    -   _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose best practices, `docs/ui-ux-spec.md` if it existed would be key here, but rely on PRD's general vision.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Compose (Modifiers for padding, spacing, size; `MaterialTheme` for colors, typography, shapes).
    -   Material Design 3 Guidelines ([https://m3.material.io/](https://m3.material.io/)).
    -   Android Studio Layout Inspector and Compose Preview tools.
    -   Accessibility testing tools/checks (e.g., Android Studio's built-in lint, Google's Accessibility Scanner app for manual checks).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Strive for a cohesive design language across the app.
    -   Use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`, `MaterialTheme.typography`, `MaterialTheme.shapes`.
    -   Leverage Compose Previews with different configurations to check consistency.
    -   Content descriptions are crucial for accessibility (`contentDescription` parameter in `Image`, `Icon`, `IconButton`).
    -   Refer to `docs/coding-standards.md` regarding Jetpack Compose Best Practices.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Theme Review & Refinement:**
    -   [ ] Review `ui/theme/Color.kt`: Ensure color definitions (primary, secondary, surface, background, error, etc.) are harmonious and provide good contrast. Use Material Theme Builder if needed.
    -   [ ] Review `ui/theme/Typography.kt`: Define or refine text styles (display, headline, title, body, label - large, medium, small variants) as needed. Ensure consistent font family.
    -   [ ] Review `ui/theme/Theme.kt`: Ensure `MaterialTheme` correctly applies the defined color scheme and typography. Check dark theme if implemented (PRD doesn't explicitly require dark theme for MVP, but if `Theme.kt` supports it, verify).
-   [ ] **Screen-by-Screen Review & Polish (`HomeScreen`, `SearchResultsScreen`, `ImageDetailScreen`):**
    -   [ ] **Spacing & Padding:** Apply consistent margins and padding around screen elements and within components (e.g., padding for TextFields, Buttons, Card content). Use `Spacer` for consistent gaps. Aim for 8dp grid alignment.
    -   [ ] **Typography:** Ensure all `Text` Composables use appropriate styles from `MaterialTheme.typography`.
    -   [ ] **Color:** Ensure all elements use colors from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` consistently. Check text on background contrast.
    -   [ ] **Iconography:** Verify all icons are from Material Symbols, are clear, and consistently styled (e.g. all filled or all outlined if a choice was made). Add/verify `contentDescription` for all `Icon` and `IconButton`s.
    -   [ ] **Alignment & Hierarchy:** Check elements are logically grouped and aligned. Ensure clear visual hierarchy (e.g., important actions are prominent).
    -   [ ] **Touch Targets:** For all interactive elements (buttons, list items if clickable), ensure their clickable area is at least 48dp x 48dp using `Modifier.sizeIn(minWidth = 48.dp, minHeight = 48.dp)` or by ensuring element size + padding achieves this. Use `Modifier.clickable` on a larger, padded container if the visual element is small.
    -   [ ] **Clutter Reduction:** Remove any unnecessary visual elements or simplify layouts where possible.
-   [ ] **Component Review (`ImageItem.kt`, `ErrorView.kt`, Loading Indicators):**
    -   [ ] Apply the same consistency checks (spacing, typography, color, icons, touch targets, accessibility) to these reusable components.
    -   [ ] For `ImageItem`, ensure `contentDescription` for the image is meaningful (e.g., `photo.alt` or "Photo by ${photo.photographer}").
-   [ ] **Accessibility Pass:**
    -   [ ] Manually review screens for text contrast (use online tools or Android Studio checks).
    -   [ ] Confirm all images and icon buttons have non-empty, descriptive `contentDescription`s.
    -   [ ] Check focus order if complex forms were present (not many in this app).
    -   [ ] Test with a screen reader (TalkBack) for critical flows if possible.
-   [ ] **General Refinement:** Address any awkward transitions, visual inconsistencies, or elements that don't feel "production quality" as per PRD.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Not primary for visual polish, but unit tests for any utility functions related to styling or accessibility could be written.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later, or enhance existing) Tests can assert `contentDescription`s, and potentially basic layout properties using semantic queries, but much of this is visual. Screenshot testing (if set up, post-MVP as per `testing-strategy.md`) would be ideal here.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary for this story):**
    -   AC1-AC7: Systematically go through each screen and component:
        -   Visually inspect for consistent spacing, padding, typography, and color usage.
        -   Verify icon consistency and their `contentDescription`s (e.g., using Layout Inspector).
        -   Manually check touch target sizes (can approximate with visual cues or use developer options like "Pointer location" to measure).
        -   Use Accessibility Scanner or manually check contrast and descriptions.
        -   Navigate through all app flows (search, view results, pagination, view detail, error states) to ensure a cohesive and polished experience.
        -   Compare against Material 3 guidelines and the project's "clean, modern, intuitive" vision.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for testing approaches and `docs/coding-standards.md` for style guidelines.)_
