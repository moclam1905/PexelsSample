# Story 6.4: Ensure Performance and Handle High-Resolution Images for Zoom

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pinch-to-zoom feature to perform smoothly without jank, even with high-resolution images, and manage memory efficiently.

**Context:** This story addresses a critical non-functional requirement for the pinch-to-zoom feature (Epic 6). With the core mechanics and constraints in place, the focus shifts to performance testing and ensuring stability when dealing with potentially large images from Pexels, as highlighted in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [181, 183].

## Detailed Requirements

* Load `Photo.src.large2x` or `Photo.src.original` (as decided in Story 4.3 for `ImageDetailScreen`) into the `AsyncImage` Composable.
* Test pinch-to-zoom, pan, and double-tap performance with various image sizes and aspect ratios sourced from Pexels API, focusing on responsiveness and maintaining a target frame rate (e.g., 60fps).
* Profile the application using Android Studio's Profiler (CPU, Memory, Energy) if jank, lag, or excessive resource consumption is observed during zoom/pan transformations or animations.
* Ensure matrix transformations in `Modifier.graphicsLayer` and boundary/constraint calculations (from Story 6.2) are performed efficiently, not causing bottlenecks on the UI thread.
* If significant performance issues (persistent jank below target FPS) or `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions occur with *typical* "original" images from Pexels (not extremely oversized outliers) *after* applying the current Compose-native transformation approach:
    * A separate technical spike/story will be created to investigate and potentially integrate a subsampling image view solution compatible with Compose (e.g., researching libraries mentioned in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [169-172] or custom tiling). For *this story*, the goal is to validate the current native approach first.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Pinching, panning, and double-tap zoom animations are smooth (consistently near 60fps, minimal dropped frames) on target test devices/emulators when using `Photo.src.large2x` (or `Photo.src.original` if that was the choice).
* AC2: The application handles images loaded from `Photo.src.large2x` (and typical `Photo.src.original`) in the zoom view without `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions during normal interaction on devices with reasonable memory (e.g., mid-range devices from recent years).
* AC3: There is no noticeable lag or jank during continuous zoom/pan interactions with these images.
* AC4: Android Studio Profiler shows no critical performance bottlenecks (e.g., long frames, excessive allocations) on the UI thread directly attributable to the zoom/pan gesture handling or `graphicsLayer` transformations during typical interaction.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Stories 6.1-6.3 are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` (Potential minor optimizations if identified).
    * No new files typically, but analysis might lead to refactoring.
    * _(Hint: `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [179, 181, 183] on performance, and PRD NFRs [43, 44, 326, 383].)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Android Studio Profiler (CPU, Memory, Jank detection/Frame Vitals).
    * Jetpack Compose recomposition tracking.
    * Coil image loading (ensure it's configured optimally, though Coil itself is generally performant).
    * Efficient Kotlin code for calculations in gesture handlers.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` and `docs/coding-standards.md` on performance.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Relies on Coil loading images from URLs specified in `Photo.src.large2x` or `Photo.src.original`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Existing states for zoom/pan.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Minimize calculations done directly within the `pointerInput` lambda if they are very complex; hoist if possible or use `derivedStateOf` appropriately.
    * Ensure `remember` is used correctly for expensive calculations that don't need to run on every recomposition.
    * Profile on release builds or `profileable` builds for more accurate performance data.
    * If subsampling becomes necessary (outside this story's direct scope but as a result of its findings), that will involve significant architectural changes for the image display.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards, especially "Performance First" for animations.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Confirm Image Source:** Verify that `ImageDetailScreen` is indeed loading the intended high-resolution image URL (e.g., `photo.src.large2x` or `photo.src.original`).
* [ ] **Performance Testing Protocol:**
    * [ ] Select a diverse set of test images from Pexels: varying dimensions, aspect ratios, and file sizes (focus on `large2x` and typical `original` sizes).
    * [ ] Test on a range of devices/emulators: a mid-range physical device is ideal, plus an emulator.
    * [ ] Perform repeated zoom (min to max, max to min), pan (across all boundaries), and double-tap interactions.
* [ ] **Execution & Profiling:**
    * [ ] Run the app and interact heavily with the zoom/pan features on `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * [ ] Use Android Studio Profiler:
        * Monitor CPU usage for spikes during gestures.
        * Monitor Memory allocation; look for rapid increases or failure to GC leading to OOMEs.
        * Use "Frame Vitals" (if available in profiler/JankStats) or visually inspect for jank/dropped frames.
        * Check Compose Recomposition counts in Layout Inspector to ensure no excessive recompositions are triggered by gesture state changes.
* [ ] **Analyze Findings & Optimize (if needed within current approach):**
    * [ ] If minor jank is found, review `graphicsLayer` usage, state read/write efficiency, and complexity of calculations within gesture handlers or recompositions.
    * [ ] Ensure all states driving `graphicsLayer` are efficiently updated and read.
    * [ ] Confirm Coil is caching effectively for repeated views (though less relevant for single detail view performance, more for grid).
* [ ] **Memory Management Check:**
    * [ ] Navigate into and out of `ImageDetailScreen` multiple times with different images.
    * [ ] Monitor memory heap for leaks or excessive retained memory related to the zoomable image view.
* [ ] **Document Findings:**
    * [ ] Note performance on test devices/images.
    * [ ] If OOMEs or significant, persistent jank occur with *typical high-resolution images* from Pexels using the current native Compose approach, document this as a key finding. This will trigger the decision for a follow-up spike/story on subsampling.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not applicable directly for performance profiling, but any algorithmic optimizations made to calculations should be unit tested for correctness.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * Automated UI tests can execute gestures, but measuring FPS or OOMEs directly in these tests is complex. They primarily serve functional validation.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` [Epic 6 points].)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary for this story, using Profiler):**
    * AC1: Manually perform zoom/pan/double-tap gestures on various images. Visually assess smoothness. Use Android Studio's Profiler (Frame Vitals / CPU rendering speed) to get quantitative data on frame rates during these interactions.
    * AC2: Load several high-resolution images (`large2x` or `original`) consecutively and interact with zoom. Monitor memory for OOMEs using Profiler.
    * AC3: Correlate visual assessment of lag/jank with Profiler data.
    * AC4: Analyze CPU traces and recomposition counts from Profiler/Layout Inspector during gesture interactions to identify any bottlenecks.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and PRD NFRs [43, 44, 326, 383].)_
