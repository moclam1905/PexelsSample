# Story 5.5: Comprehensive Loading State Refinement

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear and non-intrusive loading indicators whenever the app is fetching data, so I understand that activity is in progress.

**Context:** This story ensures all data loading operations throughout the app provide clear visual feedback. While basic loading indicators were introduced (Story 2.4 for initial search, Story 3.4 for pagination), this story is about reviewing and refining them for consistency, appropriate placement, and ensuring they interact correctly with content, empty, and error states.

## Detailed Requirements

* Review all data loading operations:
    * Initial search (Story 2.4 - `SearchViewModel.isLoading`).
    * Pagination/loading more results (Story 3.4 - `SearchViewModel.isLoadingMore`).
    * Loading full image in detail view (Story 4.3 - Coil's `AsyncImage` placeholder/loading state).
* Ensure `CircularProgressIndicator` or other suitable Material 3 loading indicators (like `LinearProgressIndicator` if appropriate) are displayed correctly.
* For full-screen loads (e.g., initial search on `SearchResultsScreen` if it's the first time data is shown there, or on `HomeScreen` if results shown there): The indicator should ideally be centered and prominent.
* For list pagination (`SearchResultsScreen`): The indicator should be at the end of the list/grid, as implemented in Story 3.4.
* For in-place content loading (like an image in `ImageDetailScreen` via `AsyncImage`): The placeholder mechanism of `AsyncImage` serves as the loading indicator. Ensure this is visually effective.
* Ensure loading indicators are promptly removed once data is loaded OR an error occurs.
* Ensure content is appropriately hidden or shown when loading states change (e.g., don't show "No results found" or an old list of images while new initial data is still loading). The screen should show loading OR content OR empty OR error, not conflicting states.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: A centered `CircularProgressIndicator` is shown on `SearchResultsScreen` when `SearchViewModel.isLoading` is true (initial data load for a query) and no prior data/error is displayed for that query context.
-   AC2: The pagination loading indicator (`CircularProgressIndicator` at the bottom of the grid in `SearchResultsScreen`) is correctly shown when `SearchViewModel.isLoadingMore` is true.
-   AC3: Coil's `AsyncImage` placeholders (for `ImageItem` in grid and full image in `ImageDetailScreen`) function effectively as loading indicators for individual images.
-   AC4: All loading indicators are promptly hidden when their respective loading operation completes (data loaded or error occurred).
-   AC5: The UI correctly transitions between loading, content, empty, and error states on all relevant screens without showing conflicting information (e.g., showing both a loading spinner for new search and old results simultaneously).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Epics 1-4 and previous Epic 5 stories are complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt` (minor adjustments to state exposure if needed).
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (if it has its own loading state before navigation).
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt` (primary focus for initial and pagination load indicators).
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` (review Coil `AsyncImage` placeholder).
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt` (review Coil `AsyncImage` placeholder).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` for state management and Compose best practices.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Compose (`CircularProgressIndicator`, `Box`, conditional rendering logic).
    -   `SearchViewModel` state flags (`isLoading`, `isLoadingMore`, `photos`, `errorState`, `isResultsEmpty`).
    -   Coil `AsyncImage` and its state handling for placeholders.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Relies on timing of state updates in `SearchViewModel` around API calls.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   ViewModel states.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Loading indicators should be consistent in style (e.g., Material 3 `CircularProgressIndicator`).
    -   Ensure UI state transitions are smooth and logical. No flickering or showing multiple states at once.
    -   The hierarchy of states should be: Loading > Error > Empty/Content.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] **Review `SearchViewModel.kt` state management:**
    -   [x] Ensure `isLoading` is true *only* during the initial fetch for a new search query (or first load on screen).
    -   [x] Ensure `isLoadingMore` is true *only* during pagination fetches.
    -   [x] Ensure both are set to `false` in `finally` blocks or after success/error is fully processed.
    -   [x] Ensure `photos`, `isResultsEmpty`, `errorState` are updated *after* loading flags are appropriately managed or in a way that UI can derive the correct view. For instance, when `isLoading` becomes true for a new search, `photos` list for previous search and `isResultsEmpty` should be cleared/reset.
-   [x] **Refine `SearchResultsScreen.kt` loading display:**
    -   [x] When `viewModel.isLoading` is true (initial load for the current query context):
        -   [x] Display a centered `CircularProgressIndicator`.
        -   [x] Ensure previous results (if any from a *different* query), "empty results" message, or error messages are hidden.
    -   [x] The pagination indicator (`isLoadingMore`) logic from Story 3.4 should be reviewed:
        -   [x] Ensure it appears at the bottom of the grid and doesn't interfere with the main content area or initial loading indicator.
    -   [x] Consolidate conditional logic for showing content vs. loading vs. error vs. empty:
        ```kotlin
        // Simplified logic structure:
        // val photos = viewModel.photos.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value
        // val isLoadingInitial = viewModel.isLoading.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value
        // val isLoadingMore = viewModel.isLoadingMore.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value
        // val error = viewModel.errorState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value
        // val isEmpty = viewModel.isResultsEmpty.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value
        // val searchAttempted = viewModel.searchAttempted.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value // Assuming this state exists

        // if (isLoadingInitial && photos.isEmpty() && !error) { // Show full screen loader only if no data/error yet for this attempt
        //     CenteredCircularProgressIndicator()
        // } else if (error != null) {
        //     ErrorView(error, onRetry = { viewModel.retry... })
        // } else if (photos.isEmpty() && searchAttempted && !isLoadingInitial) { // Check searchAttempted
        //     EmptyResultsView(query = viewModel.searchQuery.value)
        // } else if (photos.isNotEmpty()) {
        //     LazyVerticalGrid {
        //         // ... items ...
        //         if (isLoadingMore) {
        //             // ... pagination loader item ...
        //         }
        //     }
        // } else {
        //     // Initial state before any search, or prompt to search
        //     InitialPromptToSearch() // e.g. if HomeScreen and SearchResultsScreen are combined
        // }
        ```
-   [x] **Review `ImageDetailScreen.kt` and `ImageItem.kt`:**
    -   [x] Confirm Coil's `AsyncImage` `placeholder` composable/painter provides a clear indication of loading for individual images.
    -   [x] Ensure the placeholder is not jarring and fits the item's dimensions.
-   [ ] **Test all transitions:**
    -   Initial load -> content.
    -   Initial load -> error.
    -   Initial load -> empty results.
    -   Content -> pagination load -> more content.
    -   Content -> pagination load -> error during pagination.
    -   Error -> retry -> loading -> content/error.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   Verify correct setting and resetting of `isLoading` and `isLoadingMore` flags in all scenarios (new search, pagination, success, error).
    -   Verify states like `photos`, `isResultsEmpty`, `errorState` are correctly managed in conjunction with loading states to prevent UI conflicts.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later) Test specific UI transitions:
        -   ViewModel emits `isLoading=true` -> UI shows centered spinner.
        -   ViewModel emits `isLoading=false`, `photos= nonEmptyList` -> UI shows grid.
        -   ViewModel emits `isLoadingMore=true` -> UI shows bottom spinner in grid.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary for this story):**
    -   AC1: Perform a new search. Verify a centered `CircularProgressIndicator` appears on `SearchResultsScreen` while data is fetched, and old content/messages are hidden.
    -   AC2: Scroll to trigger pagination. Verify the bottom loading indicator appears correctly.
    -   AC3: Observe image loading in the grid (`ImageItem`) and on the `ImageDetailScreen`. Confirm placeholders are effective.
    -   AC4: Verify all loading indicators disappear promptly upon data load or error.
    -   AC5: Test various sequences:
        -   Search "cats" (results) -> search "asdfqwertzxcv" (empty) -> search "dogs" (results). Ensure loading indicators are shown for "asdfqwertzxcv" and "dogs" searches, and the UI correctly transitions from content to loading to empty, then loading to content.
        -   Search "sky" (many results) -> scroll to paginate. Turn off internet during pagination. Verify pagination loader stops and error appears. Turn internet on, retry error. Verify pagination resumes.
        -   Ensure no old data is shown while a new search is loading.
