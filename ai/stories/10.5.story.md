# Story 10.5: Enhance HomeScreen UI/UX (Placeholders, Shimmer, Spacing, Corners)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the `HomeScreen` grid of trending photos to look highly polished and modern, with smooth loading indicators for images and visually appealing item presentation.

**Context:** This story focuses on the UI polish aspects for the `HomeScreen`'s `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`, specifically for displaying trending photos. This includes implementing shimmer loading effects for individual image placeholders, ensuring consistent item spacing, applying rounded corners to items, and setting proper content padding for the grid. This aligns with PRD v1.2 [48], [57], [89], [193], [202], [234], [464], [473], [505] and the `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md` document.

## Detailed Requirements

* Define `Arrangement.spacedBy(...)` for `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`'s `verticalItemSpacing` and `horizontalArrangement` on `HomeScreen` to ensure consistent spacing between items (e.g., 8.dp).
* Apply `Modifier.clip(RoundedCornerShape(X.dp))` (e.g., 12.dp) to each `ImageItem` Composable when it's used within the `HomeScreen`'s trending photos grid. This modification should ideally be part of the `ImageItem` itself or applied via a modifier from `HomeScreen`.
* The `AsyncImage` Composable (within `ImageItem`) should use a color placeholder. This should be `Photo.avgColor` if available and parsed quickly, or a default light grey color if `avgColor` is problematic or not yet loaded. This behavior, established in Story 3.2 for `ImageItem`, should be verified and consistently applied in the context of the `HomeScreen`'s grid.
* Implement or integrate a shimmer effect:
  * Research and select a suitable Jetpack Compose shimmer effect library (e.g., a Compose-compatible version of Facebook's Shimmer, or another well-regarded option like those explored in `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md`). Alternatively, a basic custom shimmer animation can be implemented. The chosen library (if any) should be added as a project dependency.
  * The shimmer effect should be applied as a visual overlay or background to the placeholder areas of `ImageItem`s on the `HomeScreen` while their actual images are being loaded by Coil. This means the placeholder (e.g., the colored `Box`) will have the shimmer animation applied.
* Add `contentPadding` to the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` (e.g., horizontal 12.dp, vertical 8.dp) to ensure the grid content isn't flush against the screen edges.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [x] AC1: Items in the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` have consistent vertical and horizontal spacing applied (e.g., 8.dp between items).
* [x] AC2: `ImageItem`s displayed in the `HomeScreen` grid have visibly rounded corners (e.g., 12.dp radius).
* [x] AC3: A shimmer loading effect is displayed over the placeholder area of each `ImageItem` on `HomeScreen` (which uses `Photo.avgColor` or a default gray as its base) while its respective image is loading via Coil. The shimmer animation should be smooth, visually appealing, and performant.
* [x] AC4: The `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` on `HomeScreen` has appropriate `contentPadding` applied, ensuring a margin from the screen edges.
* [x] AC5: The overall loading experience for individual images within the `HomeScreen` grid feels polished and modern, with the shimmer effect enhancing perceived performance by making the loading state less static.
* [x] AC6: The `ImageItem` on `HomeScreen` uses `photo.alt` for its `contentDescription` for accessibility, as per PRD [49], [194], [465] and PO analysis recommendation.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 10.1 (basic `HomeScreen` grid) is established. `ImageItem` (from Epic 3, Story 3.2) is reused.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (for `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` parameters like spacing and `contentPadding`).
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt` (to integrate the shimmer effect over its placeholder, verify/apply rounded corners consistently, and ensure `contentDescription` is correctly set).
    * `libs.versions.toml` & `app/build.gradle.kts` (if a new shimmer library is chosen and added).
  * Files to Create:
    * Potentially `ShimmerBrush.kt` or a reusable `ShimmerPlaceholderComposable.kt` if implementing a custom shimmer or creating a wrapper around a library.
  * _(Hint: `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md` [Enhanced UI/UX section]. PRD [89], [202], [234], [473], [505]. `tech-stack.md v1.2` indicates shimmer library is TBD. `coding-standards.md v1.2` updated for shimmer guidelines.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Jetpack Compose: `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` parameters (`verticalItemSpacing`, `horizontalArrangement`, `contentPadding`), `Modifier.clip(RoundedCornerShape)`, `Modifier.background`, `PaddingValues`.
  * Coil `AsyncImage` (for its placeholder support and actual image loading).
  * Shimmer Effect:
    * Library option: e.g., `com.valentinilk.shimmer-compose` (if available and stable for Compose M3) or check `com.google.accompanist:accompanist-placeholder` (if its shimmer is M3 compatible or can be adapted).
    * Custom option: Implement using Compose graphics APIs like `Brush.linearGradient` with animated properties.
  * _(Hint: `tech-stack.md v1.2`. `coding-standards.md v1.2`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Not applicable.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
  * Not applicable directly to this story's UI polish tasks.
  * _(Hint: See `data-models.md v1.1`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
  * Not applicable.
  * _(Hint: See `environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The shimmer effect should be subtle yet effective, and most importantly, highly performant, especially in a grid.
  * Rounded corner radius and spacing values should be consistent with Material Design principles or the app's defined design language.
  * Ensure the shimmer animation correctly starts when an image begins loading and stops when the image is successfully loaded or if loading fails (error placeholder should then be shown without shimmer).
  * The `contentDescription` for `ImageItem`s is critical for accessibility.
  * Adhere to guidelines in `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md v1.2`.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] **Implement Grid Spacing and Content Padding in `HomeScreen.kt`:**
  * [x] Set `verticalItemSpacing = 8.dp` (or a chosen value like `dimensionResource(id = R.dimen.grid_spacing)`) on `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`.
  * [x] Set `horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp)` (or chosen value) for `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`.
  * [x] Apply `contentPadding = PaddingValues(horizontal = 12.dp, vertical = 8.dp)` (or chosen values) to `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`.
* [x] **Modify `ImageItem.kt` for Rounded Corners and Accessibility:**
  * [x] Ensure the root container of `ImageItem` (e.g., a `Card` or `Box` that wraps the `AsyncImage`) has `Modifier.clip(RoundedCornerShape(12.dp))` (or a chosen value like `dimensionResource(id = R.dimen.card_corner_radius)`). This might be conditional if `ImageItem` is used in contexts where rounded corners are not desired, but for `HomeScreen` grid, they are required.
  * [x] Verify `AsyncImage` uses `contentDescription = photo.alt.ifBlank { "Photo by ${photo.photographer}" }` to fulfill AC6.
* [x] **Research, Select, and Integrate Shimmer Effect into `ImageItem.kt`:**
  * [x] **Decision Point:** Choose a shimmer library or decide on custom implementation.
    * [x] If Library: Add dependency to `libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle.kts`. Update `docs/tech-stack.md` with the chosen library and version.
    * [ ] If Custom: Plan basic implementation (e.g., animated linear gradient brush).
  * [x] Modify `ImageItem.kt` to apply the shimmer effect. This typically involves:
    * [x] Having the `AsyncImage`'s `placeholder` slot display a base placeholder (e.g., `Box` with `photo.avgColor` background).
    * [x] Conditionally applying the shimmer modifier to this placeholder `Box` when Coil's `AsyncImagePainter.State` indicates loading.
      ```kotlin
      // Conceptual Example in ImageItem.kt using AsyncImage's onState to control shimmer:
      // var showShimmer by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
      // AsyncImage(
      //     model = ...,
      //     onState = { state -> showShimmer = state is AsyncImagePainter.State.Loading },
      //     placeholder = {
      //         Box(
      //             modifier = Modifier
      //                 .fillMaxSize()
      //                 .background(parseColor(photo.avgColor)) // Base placeholder
      //                 .then(if (showShimmer) Modifier.shimmerEffect() else Modifier) // Apply shimmer
      //         )
      //     },
      //     // ... other params ...
      // )
      // Where Modifier.shimmerEffect() is from the chosen library or custom implementation.
      ```
* [ ] Test the shimmer effect thoroughly: ensure it's smooth, covers the intended placeholder area, and correctly stops when the image loads or if loading results in an error (the error placeholder should not shimmer).
* [ ] Visually verify item spacing, rounded corners, and overall grid content padding on `HomeScreen`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
  * Not primary for these visual UI polish elements. If custom shimmer logic is complex and extracted, it could be unit-tested.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
  * (Can be challenging to assert shimmer animation directly).
  * Can verify that `contentPadding` is applied to the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` if the testing framework allows querying such layout properties.
  * Can verify that `ImageItem`s have a clip modifier applied (if inspectable via semantics).
  * Can verify `contentDescription` is correctly set on `ImageItem`s.
  * _(Refer to `testing-strategy.md v1.2`.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
  * AC1: Visually inspect the `HomeScreen`'s trending photos grid. Confirm consistent and adequate spacing between all items, both vertically and horizontally.
  * AC2: Confirm that all `ImageItem`s displayed in the `HomeScreen` grid have visibly rounded corners.
  * AC3: As images load into the `HomeScreen` grid (especially on a slower network connection or on first app load after clearing cache), verify that a shimmer animation is displayed over the placeholder areas of the `ImageItem`s *before* the image appears. The shimmer should be smooth and not cause UI jank.
  * AC4: Confirm that the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` has appropriate padding from the screen edges, so items don't abut the absolute screen borders.
  * AC5: Assess the overall visual appeal during image loading on `HomeScreen`. The combination of placeholders and the shimmer effect should create a professional and less jarring loading experience, enhancing perceived performance.
  * AC6: Using an accessibility inspector tool (like Layout Inspector's semantics view or by enabling TalkBack), verify that images displayed in the `ImageItem`s on `HomeScreen` have their `contentDescription` correctly set (e.g., from `photo.alt`).
