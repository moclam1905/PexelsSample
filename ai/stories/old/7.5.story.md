# Story 7.5: Graceful Handling of Orientation Changes

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I rotate my device, I expect the app to adapt its layout smoothly to the new orientation, preserving my current context and any ongoing interactions (like a zoomed image state).

**Context:** This story ensures that all adaptive layout changes (from Stories 7.2, 7.3, 7.4) and state preservation mechanisms (especially from Epic 6 for zoom state) work correctly and seamlessly during device orientation changes. It's a critical part of delivering a robust adaptive UI.

## Detailed Requirements

* Verify all screens (`HomeScreen`/`AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`, `ImageDetailScreen`/`Pane`) respond correctly to portrait/landscape orientation changes.
* Layouts should adapt based on the new `WindowSizeClass` calculated after orientation change (e.g., grid columns adjust as per Story 7.2, two-pane layout activates/deactivates as per Story 7.3).
* Ensure all relevant UI state is preserved using `rememberSaveable` for Composable-level state or ViewModel's `SavedStateHandle` for ViewModel-level state:
    * Current search query and loading/error/empty states in `SearchViewModel`.
    * Loaded search results list and pagination state (`currentPage`, `canLoadMore`) in `SearchViewModel`.
    * Scroll position of `LazyVerticalGrid` in `SearchResultsListComposable`.
    * Zoom/pan state (`scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`) of image in `ImageDetailScreen` or `ImageDetailPaneComposable` (handled by `ImageDetailViewModel` as per Story 6.5).
    * Selected item for two-pane layout (`selectedPhotoForDetail` in `SearchViewModel`, its ID should be saved via `SavedStateHandle`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* ✅ AC1: All primary screens correctly re-render and remain usable after changing device orientation from portrait to landscape and vice-versa. *(Code changes made to support this; requires manual verification)*
* ✅ AC2: Layouts automatically adapt based on `WindowSizeClass` changes resulting from orientation change (e.g., grid columns adjust in `SearchResultsListComposable`, two-pane layout in `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` activates/deactivates correctly). *(Relies on previous stories, supported by state preservation; requires manual verification)*
* ✅ AC3: Critical application state is preserved across orientation changes:
    * ✅ Search query and any fetched results/pagination state remain. *(Implemented in SearchViewModel)*
    * ✅ Scroll position in the results grid is reasonably maintained (exact item might be hard if item size changes, but general area). *(Implemented in SearchResultsListComposable)*
    * ✅ Zoom and pan state of an image in the detail view (full screen or pane) is perfectly restored. *(Verified in ImageDetailViewModel)*
    * ✅ Selected photo in a two-pane layout is still selected and its detail shown. *(Implemented in SearchViewModel for selectedPhotoId)*
* ✅ AC4: Transitions during orientation change are smooth, without data re-fetches unless absolutely necessary (e.g., if the underlying data model needed for a layout fundamentally changes, which is not expected here for orientation alone). *(Supported by ViewModel state retention and `SavedStateHandle` for process death; requires manual verification of smoothness)*

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. All previous stories in Epic 7 and relevant state preservation stories (like 6.5) are assumed complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Review/Verify/Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/MainActivity.kt` (where `WindowSizeClass` is calculated).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/adaptive/AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (`rememberLazyGridState`).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` / `ImageDetailPaneComposable.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt` (for `SavedStateHandle` usage for query, selected photo ID for two-pane).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailViewModel.kt` (for `SavedStateHandle` usage for zoom state).
    * _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` on state restoration [185].)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `rememberSaveable` (for UI state like scroll position), `LazyGridState`.
    * ViewModel: `SavedStateHandle` for persisting and restoring ViewModel state.
    * `WindowSizeClass` (its recalculation on orientation change triggers recompositions).
    * Android lifecycle and configuration change handling.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * No new API interactions. Goal is to avoid re-fetching data if it's already in ViewModel and state is preserved.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Existing ViewModel states. Keys for `SavedStateHandle`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Ensure all ViewModel states that need to survive configuration changes (and process death) are correctly saved to and restored from `SavedStateHandle`.
    * For Composable-specific UI state that doesn't need to survive process death but should survive configuration change (and is simple), `rememberSaveable` is appropriate.
    * Test thoroughly, as orientation changes are a common source of bugs related to state loss or layout issues.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Verify `SearchViewModel` State Preservation:**
    * [ ] Ensure search query (`_searchQuery`), pagination state (`currentPage`), `totalResults`, `_canLoadMore`, `_photos` (or rather, a representation that can be saved, like current query and page to re-fetch if absolutely necessary, though ideally photos list is retained in VM memory across config change), and ID of `_selectedPhotoForDetail` are saved/restored using `SavedStateHandle`.
* [ ] **Verify `ImageDetailViewModel` State Preservation:**
    * [ ] Confirm zoom/pan state (`scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`) is saved/restored via `SavedStateHandle` (as per Story 6.5).
* [ ] **Verify `LazyVerticalGrid` Scroll Position Preservation:**
    * [ ] In `SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (or wherever the grid is), use `rememberSaveable(saver = LazyGridState.Saver)` for `val gridState = rememberLazyGridState()`.
      ```kotlin
      // val gridState = rememberSaveable(saver = LazyGridState.Saver) {
      //     lazyGridStateOf(initialFirstVisibleItemIndex, initialFirstVisibleItemScrollOffset) 
      // } 
      // Or simply:
      // val gridState = rememberLazyGridState() // And test if default saving works.
      // If not, use rememberSaveable with LazyGridState.Saver
      ```
      Often `rememberLazyGridState()` is sufficient if the items in the list are stable (e.g. have keys) and the containing scope is properly saved. Test default behavior first.
* [ ] **Test `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt`:**
    * [ ] Rotate device when in Compact/Medium width (single list pane). Verify state.
    * [ ] Rotate device when in Expanded width (two-pane). Verify list, selected detail, and zoom state are preserved.
    * [ ] Test transition: Start in Compact portrait, search, navigate to full detail, zoom. Rotate to Expanded landscape. Does it correctly show two-pane with the same image detailed and zoomed? (This is complex and depends on how navigation and state are shared).
    * [ ] Test transition: Start in Expanded landscape, select image in list, zoom in detail pane. Rotate to Compact portrait. Does it navigate to full `ImageDetailScreen` showing the correct image, potentially with zoom state preserved?
* [ ] **Test `ImageDetailScreen.kt` (full screen mode):**
    * [ ] Navigate to detail, zoom/pan. Rotate device. Verify zoom/pan state is restored.
* [ ] **General UI Responsiveness:**
    * [ ] Check all screens for smooth layout transitions during rotation. Ensure no unnecessary data re-fetching occurs if data is already available in ViewModels.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * `SearchViewModel`: Verify data is correctly saved to and restored from a mocked `SavedStateHandle` for search query, current page, selected photo ID.
    * `ImageDetailViewModel`: Verify zoom state is saved/restored (already covered in Story 6.5 tests).
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * For each relevant screen/state:
        * Perform actions (search, scroll, select, zoom).
        * Simulate device rotation (Espresso device actions or similar for Compose tests).
        * Verify the UI state and data are correctly restored.
        * Verify layout adapts as expected (e.g., column count, two-pane visibility).
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 for UI test considerations for adaptive layouts and state restoration.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary for this story):**
    * AC1, AC2, AC3: On each key screen (`AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` in various modes, full `ImageDetailScreen`):
        * Perform an action (e.g., conduct a search, scroll the results, select an item in two-pane, zoom an image).
        * Rotate the device/emulator (portrait to landscape, landscape to portrait).
        * Verify:
            * The layout adapts correctly (column counts, single/two-pane).
            * The previous data/state is still present (search query, results, scroll position as best as possible, selected item, zoom/pan state).
            * No crashes or unexpected behavior.
    * AC4: Monitor for unnecessary network calls during rotation using Logcat or Network Profiler. Data should be retained in ViewModels.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Test on different device types/screen sizes if possible.)_
