# Story 8.6: Interaction with Search History Items

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to tap on a recent search term to quickly re-run that search, and I want options to manage my search history.

**Context:** This story makes the search history displayed in Story 8.5 interactive. Users will be able to select a history item to perform a search, delete individual items, and clear the entire history. This completes PRD v1.1 requirements [319-320].

## Detailed Requirements

* Make each item in the recent searches list (displayed in Story 8.5) clickable.
* On tap of a history item, `SearchViewModel` should:
    * Update its current search query state (`_searchQuery.value`) with the selected term.
    * Trigger a new search for that term (i.e., call its internal search execution logic, similar to `onSearchClicked()`).
    * Set `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value = false`.
* Implement a UI mechanism (e.g., an 'X' icon `IconButton` next to each term in the list) to delete an individual search term.
    * This action should call `SearchHistoryRepository.deleteSearchTerm(term)` via the `SearchViewModel`.
    * The `recentSearches` list in UI and `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions` state should update reactively.
* Provide a "Clear All" button/option, visible when the recent searches UI is displayed and history is not empty.
    * This action should call `SearchHistoryRepository.clearSearchHistory()` via the `SearchViewModel`.
    * The UI should update reactively (list becomes empty, `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions` becomes false or shows "no history").

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [x] AC1: Tapping a recent search term in the suggestions list populates the main search input field with that term and automatically initiates a new image search for that term. The suggestions list hides.
* [x] AC2: Each recent search item has a visible "delete" icon/button. Clicking it removes the term from the displayed list and from the persisted search history in DataStore.
* [x] AC3: A "Clear All" option is available when search history is displayed. Clicking it removes all terms from the displayed list and from DataStore. The suggestions UI then shows "No recent searches" or hides.
* [x] AC4: The UI updates immediately and correctly after a history item is tapped for search, an item is deleted, or all history is cleared.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 8.5 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (or `SearchSuggestionsComposable.kt` if used).
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` v1.1. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [243, 245] for interaction patterns.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * `SearchViewModel`, `StateFlow`, Kotlin Coroutines.
    * `SearchHistoryRepository` (delete/clear methods).
    * Jetpack Compose (`Modifier.clickable`, `IconButton`, `Icon`, `Button`, `LazyColumn` item interactions).
    * Material Symbols for delete icon (e.g., `Icons.Filled.Close` or `Icons.Outlined.Clear`).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Interacts with `SearchHistoryRepository`. Triggers image search via existing mechanisms.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Existing ViewModel states.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` v1.1.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Ensure clear visual affordance for delete actions.
    * Confirmation for "Clear All" might be considered for a non-MVP polish but is not required by this story.
    * Reactive updates to UI are crucial. Re-fetching history or relying on `Flow` emissions from repository after modification is key.
    * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] **Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:**
    * [x] Create `fun onHistoryItemClicked(term: String)`:
        * `_searchQuery.value = term`
        * `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value = false`
        * Call the internal search logic (same as `onSearchClicked` without the blank check, or refactor `onSearchClicked` to take a query).
    * [x] Create `fun deleteHistoryItem(term: String)`:
        * `viewModelScope.launch { searchHistoryRepository.deleteSearchTerm(term) }`
        * (The `recentSearches` Flow from repository should automatically update the UI if collected with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`).
    * [x] Create `fun clearAllHistory()`:
        * `viewModelScope.launch { searchHistoryRepository.clearSearchHistory() }`
* [x] **Modify UI for recent searches list (in `HomeScreen.kt` or `SearchSuggestionsComposable.kt`):**
    * [x] Make each history item row clickable, calling `viewModel.onHistoryItemClicked(term)`.
    * [x] Add an `IconButton` with a delete icon (e.g., `Icons.Filled.Close`) to each history item row. Its `onClick` should call `viewModel.deleteHistoryItem(term)`. Ensure adequate touch target for this icon.
    * [x] Conditionally display a "Clear All" `TextButton` or `Button` at the end of the history list (or in a header/footer of the suggestions area) if `recentSearches` is not empty. Its `onClick` should call `viewModel.clearAllHistory()`.
* [x] Ensure the `LazyColumn` displaying `recentSearches` correctly recomposes when the underlying list changes due to deletions. The `Flow` from `getRecentSearches` should drive this.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    * Mock `SearchHistoryRepository` and `ImageRepository` (or search execution part).
    * Test `onHistoryItemClicked(term)`: verify `_searchQuery` updates, suggestions hide, and search logic is invoked.
    * Test `deleteHistoryItem(term)`: verify `searchHistoryRepository.deleteSearchTerm(term)` is called.
    * Test `clearAllHistory()`: verify `searchHistoryRepository.clearSearchHistory()` is called.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later)
    * Pre-populate DataStore with history. Verify list displays.
    * Tap a history item: verify search input updates, search executes, suggestions hide.
    * Tap delete icon on an item: verify item removed from UI and (by checking DataStore indirectly or re-fetching) persisted state.
    * Tap "Clear All": verify list clears/shows empty state, and persisted state is cleared.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 for UI tests for search history.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * Populate some search history by performing searches (requires Story 8.7 to save them, or a test mechanism to pre-fill DataStore).
    * AC1: Focus empty search bar to show history. Tap an item. Verify search bar populates, search runs, and history list hides.
    * AC2: In history list, click delete icon next to an item. Verify it disappears from list and is gone if you refocus to show history again.
    * AC3: Click "Clear All". Verify list becomes empty (or shows "No recent searches") and is empty if you refocus.
    * AC4: Confirm all UI updates are immediate.
