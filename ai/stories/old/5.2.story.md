# Story 5.2: Handle Network Connectivity Errors

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, if I try to use the app without an internet connection or if the connection is unstable, I want to be clearly informed about the network issue.

**Context:** This story builds upon the generic error handling (Story 5.1) by specifically detecting and messaging network connectivity errors (e.g., no internet). It involves enhancing the error detection in `SearchViewModel` and providing specific feedback via the `ErrorView`.

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement logic (e.g., in `SearchViewModel` when handling exceptions from `PexelsApiService`) to specifically detect network connectivity errors (e.g., `java.net.UnknownHostException`, `java.io.IOException` in general from OkHttp/Retrofit when no network).
* When a network error is detected, the `SearchViewModel` should update its `errorState` (from Story 5.1) to reflect a "Network Error" with a specific message.
* The UI, using the `ErrorView`, should display a message like "No internet connection. Please check your connection and try again."
* The "Retry" action should be available for network errors and should re-attempt the last failed operation.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: `SearchViewModel`'s API call error handling (in `onSearchClicked`, `loadNextPage`) specifically catches `IOException` (or more specific network exceptions like `UnknownHostException`).
-   AC2: When such a network error is caught, `SearchViewModel.errorState` is updated with a `UserFacingError` containing a specific message like "No internet connection. Please check your connection and try again." and `isRetryable = true`.
-   AC3: The `ErrorView` on `SearchResultsScreen` (or other relevant screens) displays this specific network error message.
-   AC4: The retry mechanism (from Story 5.1) successfully re-attempts the failed operation (e.g., initial search or loading more) when the network issue is potentially resolved.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Story 5.1 is complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
    -   _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` for error handling specifics.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Kotlin `try-catch` blocks for exception handling (`IOException`).
    -   `SearchViewModel` state management.
    -   `ErrorView` Composable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Focuses on handling exceptions from Retrofit/OkHttp calls made via `PexelsApiService`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `UserFacingError` data class (from Story 5.1).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` section on "Error Handling Strategy")_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Distinguish `IOException` from other API errors (like HTTP 4xx/5xx which will be Story 5.3).
    -   Provide clear, actionable messages to the user.
    -   Ensure retry is offered.
    -   A `NetworkConnectivityHandler` utility (mentioned in `architecture.md` and `project-structure.md` under `core/utils`) could be implemented to proactively check network state, but for MVP, reactive handling of exceptions from network calls is sufficient for this story. If `NetworkConnectivityHandler` is implemented, ViewModel could observe it. *Decision for MVP: Reactive handling of `IOException` is the primary focus of this story.*

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [X] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    -   [X] In the `catch` blocks of API call coroutines (within `onSearchClicked` and `loadNextPage`):
        -   [X] Add a specific catch for `java.io.IOException` (or more specific subtypes like `java.net.UnknownHostException` if desired, though `IOException` is a good general catch-all for network problems with OkHttp).
        -   [X] Inside this `catch (e: IOException)` block, set `_errorState.value = UserFacingError(message = "No internet connection. Please check your connection and try again.", isRetryable = true)`.
        -   [X] Ensure other exceptions are caught by a more general `catch (e: Exception)` block that sets a generic error message (or prepares for Story 5.3 for HTTP errors).
    -   [X] (If not already robust) Refine the retry mechanism. `SearchViewModel` could have:
        ```kotlin
        // private var lastAction: (() -> Unit)? = null
        // In onSearchClicked: lastAction = { onSearchClickedInternalLogic() }
        // In loadNextPage: lastAction = { loadNextPageInternalLogic() }
        // fun retryLastFailedOperation() { lastAction?.invoke() }
        ```
        And `ErrorView`'s onRetry would call `viewModel.retryLastFailedOperation()`.
        The "InternalLogic" methods would contain the actual API call logic without the initial state clearing/checks, which `retryLastFailedOperation` might handle or delegate.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   Mock `PexelsApiService` to throw an `IOException` when `searchPhotos` is called.
    -   Verify `SearchViewModel.errorState` is updated with the correct network error message and `isRetryable = true`.
    -   Verify that if `retryLastFailedOperation` is called, the original failing operation is re-attempted.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Not primary for this story.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1, AC2, AC3:
        -   Run app. Disable network connectivity on the emulator/device (e.g., turn on Airplane Mode).
        -   Perform a search or try to paginate.
        -   Verify the `ErrorView` appears with the "No internet connection..." message.
    -   AC4:
        -   With the error message displayed, re-enable network connectivity.
        -   Click the "Retry" button.
        -   Verify the API call is re-attempted and, if successful, results are shown and the error message disappears.
