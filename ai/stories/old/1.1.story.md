# Story 1.1: Android Project Initialization and Structure

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want a new Android Studio project initialized with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, so that I have a clean starting point adhering to modern Android development standards.

**Context:** This is the first foundational story for the PexelsSample application. Its successful completion will provide the basic project skeleton upon which all subsequent features and configurations will be built.

## Detailed Requirements

* Initialize a new Android project using Android Studio.
* Configure the project to use Kotlin as the primary language.
* Set up Jetpack Compose for UI development.
* Define basic package structure for separation of concerns (e.g., `ui`, `data`, `domain`, `di`, `utils`).
* Include necessary Gradle plugins and configurations for Kotlin, Compose, and application building.
* Ensure the project builds successfully and runs a basic "Hello World" Composable on an emulator/device.
* Establish basic version control (e.g., `.gitignore` file).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: A new Android project is created and configured for Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
-   AC2: The project includes a defined package structure for `ui`, `data`, `domain` as per `docs/project-structure.md`.
-   AC3: The app successfully builds and displays a simple Composable screen.
-   AC4: A `.gitignore` file appropriate for Android projects is present.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Create:
        -   Project root files (e.g., `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, `gradle.properties`, `.gitignore`, `libs.versions.toml`)
        -   `app/build.gradle.kts`
        -   `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/MainActivity.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/Color.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/Theme.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/Typography.kt`
        -   Initial package structure directories under `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/` as specified in `docs/project-structure.md`.
    -   Files to Modify: None initially, as these are new files.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Android Studio (latest stable version recommended)
    -   Kotlin (`2.0.21` - as per `docs/tech-stack.md`)
    -   Jetpack Compose (BOM `2024.09.00` - as per `docs/tech-stack.md`)
    -   Android Gradle Plugin (`8.9.1` - as per `docs/tech-stack.md`)
    -   Gradle (latest compatible version)
    -   Target SDK: `35`, Min SDK: `26` (as per `docs/tech-stack.md`)
    -   Version Catalog (`libs.versions.toml`) for dependency management.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for details on external APIs and SDKs)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Not applicable for this story beyond basic Composable structure.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for key project data structures)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Adhere to Kotlin Coding Conventions and use Android Studio Formatter (as per `docs/coding-standards.md`).
    -   Naming conventions: `PascalCase` for classes and Composables, `lowercase_separated_by_dots` for packages (as per `docs/coding-standards.md`).
    -   File structure as per `docs/project-structure.md`.
    -   Manage dependencies using `libs.versions.toml` (as per `docs/coding-standards.md`).
    -   Ensure `.gitignore` includes common Android ignores (e.g., `build/`, `.idea/`, `*.iml`, `local.properties`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Initialize a new Android Project in Android Studio with "Empty Activity" template (Compose-enabled).
    -   [x] Set Application Name: `PexelsSample`.
    -   [x] Set Package Name: `com.nguyenmoclam.pexelssample`.
    -   [x] Set Language: Kotlin.
    -   [x] Set Minimum SDK: API 26.
    -   [x] Build configuration language: Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`).
-   [x] Set up `libs.versions.toml` in the `gradle` directory for dependency management.
    -   [x] Define versions for Kotlin, AGP, Compose BOM, core KTX, Activity Compose, etc., as specified in `docs/tech-stack.md` (used story versions and common defaults).
-   [x] Verify and update `build.gradle.kts` (Project level) and `app/build.gradle.kts` (App level):
    -   [x] Use versions from `libs.versions.toml`.
    -   [x] Kotlin version (`libs.versions.kotlin.get()`).
    -   [x] Android Gradle Plugin version (`libs.versions.agp.get()`).
    -   [x] Jetpack Compose dependencies (use BOM: `implementation(platform(libs.androidx.compose.bom))`, then `implementation(libs.androidx.compose.ui)`, etc.).
    -   [x] `compileSdk = 35`, `targetSdk = 35`, `minSdk = 26`.
    -   [x] Enable Jetpack Compose in `android` block: `buildFeatures { compose = true }` (New Kotlin Compose plugin handles compiler version).
    -   [x] Add `implementation(libs.androidx.activity.compose)`.
-   [x] Create the basic package structure within `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/` as defined in `docs/project-structure.md`.
    -   (e.g., `core.navigation`, `data.local.dao`, `domain.model`, `ui.home`, `di`, etc.)
-   [x] Modify `MainActivity.kt`:
    -   [x] Inherit from `ComponentActivity`.
    -   [x] Set content with a basic Composable function displaying "Hello World from PexelsSample!".
    -   [x] Apply a basic Material 3 theme (e.g., `PexelsSampleTheme`).
-   [x] Create default `Color.kt`, `Theme.kt`, `Typography.kt` in `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/`.
    -   [x] `Theme.kt` should define a `PexelsSampleTheme` Composable using `MaterialTheme` (M3).
-   [x] Create/Verify `.gitignore` file at the project root:
    -   [x] Include standard Android ignores.
-   [x] Build the project and run on an emulator or device to verify AC3. (Build successful, manual run verification pending)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Not applicable for this story directly, but setup should allow for future unit tests.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   Build the project successfully in Android Studio.
    -   Run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.
    -   Verify that a screen is displayed showing "Hello World from PexelsSample!" (or similar placeholder text defined in `MainActivity`).
    -   Check the project directory structure against `docs/project-structure.md`.
    -   Verify the contents of the `.gitignore` file.
    -   Verify `libs.versions.toml` is correctly populated and used in Gradle files.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
