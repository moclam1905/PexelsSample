# Story 8.1: Implement Pull-to-Refresh Gesture on Results Screen

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when viewing image search results, I want to be able to swipe down from the top of the list to refresh the content, so I can see the latest images for my query or new curated photos.

**Context:** This story introduces the pull-to-refresh gesture on the screen displaying search results (likely `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` or the `SearchResultsListComposable` within it). It leverages Jetpack Compose's pull-to-refresh components and connects the gesture to the `SearchViewModel`. This is the first step in implementing the "Pull-to-Refresh" feature from PRD v1.1 [316].

## Detailed Requirements

* Integrate a pull-to-refresh mechanism into the screen responsible for displaying search results (e.g., `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` or the `SearchResultsListComposable` it contains).
* Utilize a Compose library component for pull-to-refresh (e.g., `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh.PullToRefreshBox` and `rememberPullToRefreshState` from Material 2, or an M3 equivalent like `androidx.compose.material3.PullToRefreshContainer` if using the M3 `pull-refresh` artifact, which should be confirmed from `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1). *Decision: Use `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh` components as specified in `tech-stack.md` v1.1 [85, 190, 209].*
* The `SearchViewModel` will need to expose an `isRefreshing: StateFlow<Boolean>` (this might be the existing `isLoading` or a new dedicated one; for clarity, let's assume `isRefreshing` is distinct for pull-to-refresh action).
* The `SearchViewModel` will also expose an `onRefreshTriggered: () -> Unit` function (or similar) to be called by the UI.
* The Composable UI will observe the `isRefreshing` state (for the indicator) and call `onRefreshTriggered` when the pull gesture is completed by the user.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Users can trigger a refresh action by swiping down from the top of the `LazyVerticalGrid` within the search results display area.
* AC2: A pull-to-refresh Composable wrapper (e.g., `PullToRefreshBox` from `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh`) is used around the `LazyVerticalGrid` (or `SearchResultsListComposable`).
* AC3: The gesture triggers the `onRefreshTriggered` lambda connected to the `SearchViewModel`.
* AC4: A visual refresh indicator (e.g., `PullToRefreshIndicator` from `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh`) is displayed appropriately during the pull gesture and while `SearchViewModel.isRefreshing` (or equivalent state) is true.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Epics 1-7 are assumed complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Create: None for this story.
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (or `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt` if it directly wraps the list).
        * `libs.versions.toml` & `app/build.gradle.kts` (to add `androidx.compose.material:material-pull-refresh:1.6.0` or equivalent from `tech-stack.md` v1.1).
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [208-212] for pull-to-refresh components. `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1 specifies `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh` at version `1.6.0`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose `pullrefresh` library: `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh.PullToRefreshBox`, `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh.rememberPullToRefreshState`, `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh.PullToRefreshIndicator`.
    * `SearchViewModel` state (`isRefreshing: StateFlow<Boolean>`) and action (`onRefreshTriggered: () -> Unit`).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1 for the pull-refresh library. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not making API calls in this story, only setting up the gesture and state linkage. Story 8.2 handles the logic.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * `isRefreshing: StateFlow<Boolean>` in `SearchViewModel`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * ViewModel should clearly separate the `isRefreshing` state for pull-to-refresh from other loading states (e.g., `isLoading` for initial search, `isLoadingMore` for pagination) if they need to behave differently or be displayed simultaneously.
    * The pull-to-refresh indicator should align with Material Design guidelines.
    * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] Add/Verify the pull-to-refresh dependency in `libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle.kts`:
    * `implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-pull-refresh:1.6.0")` (as per `tech-stack.md` v1.1, assuming this is the chosen M2 version if M3 is not fully adopted for this component or if M2 is specified there). *Confirm if an M3 version should be used if the rest of the app is M3 and an M3 pull-refresh is stable and available.* Assume M2 version for now as per tech stack doc unless M3 is explicitly available and preferred.
* [x] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    * [x] Add `private val _isRefreshing = MutableStateFlow(false)`.
    * [x] Add `val isRefreshing: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isRefreshing.asStateFlow()`.
    * [x] Add `fun onRefreshTriggered() { /* Logic to be implemented in Story 8.2 */ _isRefreshing.value = true; // Placeholder, real logic sets this then calls API }`. (Actual data fetching and setting `_isRefreshing` to `false` will be in Story 8.2).
* [x] Modify `SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (or the Composable directly containing the `LazyVerticalGrid`):
    * [x] Collect `isRefreshing` state from `SearchViewModel`: `val refreshing by viewModel.isRefreshing.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
    * [x] Create `pullRefreshState`: `val pullRefreshState = rememberPullToRefreshState(refreshing, onRefresh = { viewModel.onRefreshTriggered() })`.
    * [x] Wrap the `LazyVerticalGrid` with `PullToRefreshBox`:
      ```kotlin
      // import androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh.*
      // Box(modifier = Modifier.pullRefresh(pullRefreshState)) { // PullToRefreshBox in older versions
      PullToRefreshBox( // Check correct usage for version 1.6.0
          isRefreshing = refreshing,
          onRefresh = { viewModel.onRefreshTriggered() },
          modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize() // Or appropriate modifier
      ) {
          // LazyVerticalGrid(...) { ... }

          PullToRefreshIndicator(
              refreshing = refreshing,
              state = pullRefreshState, // Check if state is needed here for this version
              modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.TopCenter)
          )
      }
      ```
      *Note: Exact API for `PullToRefreshBox` and `PullToRefreshIndicator` might vary slightly based on the exact version (`1.6.0` material vs potential material3 artifact). The structure above is a general guide. Consult official docs for `androidx.compose.material:material-pull-refresh:1.6.0`.*
* [ ] Test the gesture and indicator visibility.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    * Test that `onRefreshTriggered()` sets `isRefreshing` to true (initially).
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later) Simulate a pull-down gesture.
    * Verify `SearchViewModel.onRefreshTriggered()` is called.
    * Verify the `PullToRefreshIndicator` appears while `isRefreshing` is true.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 UI test considerations for pull-to-refresh.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Run app, navigate to results. Swipe down from the top of the image grid. Verify the pull-to-refresh gesture is recognized.
    * AC2: Review code for `PullToRefreshBox` usage.
    * AC3: Add a log in `SearchViewModel.onRefreshTriggered()`. Verify the log appears when gesture is performed.
    * AC4: While pulling and when `isRefreshing` is (temporarily set to) true, verify the refresh indicator is displayed at the top of the content.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [208-213].)_
