# Story 4.2: Image Detail Screen UI Layout

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create the basic UI layout for the `ImageDetailScreen`, so that it can display a large image and associated metadata clearly.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 4.1, where navigation to a placeholder `ImageDetailScreen` was established. Now, we will define the actual layout structure for this screen using Jetpack Compose, preparing for content population in subsequent stories.

## Detailed Requirements

* Modify the `ImageDetailScreen(navController: NavController, photoId: Int, ...)` Composable.
* The layout should prominently feature an area for displaying the large image (e.g., using a `Box` or `AsyncImage` directly, which will be configured in Story 4.3).
* Include sections or `Text` Composables to display metadata such as:
    * Photographer's name (`Photo.photographer`).
    * Alt text or description if available (`Photo.alt`).
* Include a clear way to navigate back (e.g., a back arrow icon in an `TopAppBar`, already added as a basic in Story 4.1's placeholder).
* The screen should be scrollable if the content (image + metadata) exceeds the screen height, although for MVP the image might be constrained to fit. Use `Column` with `verticalScroll`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: `ImageDetailScreen` Composable uses a `Scaffold` with a `TopAppBar` that includes a title (e.g., "Photo by [Photographer]") and a navigation icon (back arrow) to pop the back stack.
-   AC2: The main content area of `ImageDetailScreen` (within the `Scaffold`) uses a `Column` that is `verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())`.
-   AC3: Inside the `Column`, there is a designated area for the large image (e.g., a `Box` with `Modifier.fillMaxWidth().aspectRatio(photo.width.toFloat() / photo.height.toFloat())` or a fixed aspect ratio like 16:9, awaiting `AsyncImage` in Story 4.3).
-   AC4: Below the image area, `Text` Composables are present to display metadata such as:
    -   Photographer's name (e.g., "Photographer: ${photo.photographer}").
    -   Alt text (e.g., "Description: ${photo.alt}"). These are shown if the `photo` object is loaded.
-   AC5: Basic padding and spacing are applied for a clean layout.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Story 4.1 is complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt`
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose layout best practices.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Compose (`Scaffold`, `TopAppBar`, `IconButton`, `Icon`, `Column`, `Text`, `Box`, `Modifier`, `verticalScroll`, `rememberScrollState`).
    -   Material 3 components and styling.
    -   `Photo` domain model (for determining aspect ratio and text content).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Relies on `photo: Photo?` state within `ImageDetailScreen` (from Story 4.1).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Use `Scaffold` for standard screen structure.
    -   Make the content scrollable for varying image aspect ratios and text lengths.
    -   Ensure `TopAppBar` title is dynamic based on photo data if available.
    -   Follow Material Design guidelines for spacing and typography.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Modify `ImageDetailScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] Ensure `Scaffold` and `TopAppBar` are set up as per Story 4.1's placeholder, or refine:
        -   `TopAppBar` title: `Text(photo?.photographer?.let { "Photo by $it" } ?: "Detail")` (or "Photo by ${photo?.photographer ?: "Unknown"}").
        -   Navigation icon: `IconButton` with `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ArrowBack`.
    -   [x] The main content area of the `Scaffold` (passed via `content` lambda) should be a `Column`.
    -   [x] Apply `Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(paddingValues).padding(16.dp).verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())` to the `Column`.
    -   [x] Inside the `Column`, add a `Box` placeholder for the image:
        -   `modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().background(Color.Gray)` (temporary background).
        -   To set aspect ratio based on photo (if `photo` is not null):
            `val aspectRatio = if (photo!!.height > 0) photo!!.width.toFloat() / photo!!.height.toFloat() else 1f`
            `Modifier.aspectRatio(aspectRatio.coerceIn(0.5f, 2f)) // Coerce to prevent extreme ratios`
            If `photo` is null, use a default aspect ratio e.g., `Modifier.aspectRatio(16/9f)`.
        -   This `Box` will be replaced by `AsyncImage` in Story 4.3. For now, it can have a fixed height or aspect ratio.
    -   [x] Below the image `Box`, add `Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))`.
    -   [x] Add `Text` Composable for photographer:
        -   `if (photo != null) { Text("Photographer: ${photo.photographer}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium) }`
    -   [x] Add `Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(8.dp))`.
    -   [x] Add `Text` Composable for alt text/description:
        -   `if (photo != null && photo.alt.isNotBlank()) { Text("Description: ${photo.alt}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium) }`
    -   [x] Add appropriate padding and alignment to elements.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Not primary for UI layout.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later) Verify presence of `TopAppBar`, image area `Box`, and `Text` fields for metadata. Verify scrollability if content overflows.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Run app, navigate to `ImageDetailScreen`. Verify `TopAppBar` with back arrow and a title.
    -   AC2: If metadata text is long or image aspect ratio is tall, verify the content area is scrollable.
    -   AC3: Verify a placeholder area (e.g., a gray `Box`) is visible where the image will be. Check if aspect ratio logic (if implemented) seems to apply.
    -   AC4: Verify `Text` elements for "Photographer" and "Description" are present below the image area and display correct data if a `photo` object is loaded. If `photo.alt` is blank, its `Text` should not appear.
    -   AC5: Visually inspect padding and spacing for a clean look.
