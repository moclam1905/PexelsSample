# Story 6.3: Implement Double-Tap to Zoom Functionality

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly zoom into an image or reset its zoom level by double-tapping it, providing a convenient alternative to pinch gestures.

**Context:** This story adds a common and convenient interaction for zooming, building on the pinch/pan (Story 6.1) and constraints (Story 6.2) already in place for the `ImageDetailScreen`. It utilizes Compose's gesture detection for taps and animation APIs for smooth transitions, as researched in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [176].

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement double-tap gesture detection on the image Composable in `ImageDetailScreen` using `Modifier.pointerInput` with `detectTapGestures(onDoubleTap = { tapOffset -> ... })`.
* Define an intermediate zoom level (e.g., `intermediateScale = (minScale + maxScale) / 2f` or simply `minScale * 2f`, ensuring it's within `[minScale, maxScale]`).
* On double-tap:
    * If current `scale` is approximately equal to `minScale` (fit-to-view), animate to `intermediateScale`. The zoom should ideally center around the `tapOffset` (the point of the double-tap).
    * If current `scale` is greater than `minScale`, animate back to `minScale` and reset pan offsets (`offsetX = 0f`, `offsetY = 0f`).
* Use Jetpack Compose animation APIs (e.g., `Animatable` for `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`, or `animate*AsState` if simpler) for smooth transitions during double-tap zoom actions.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Double-tapping a "fit-to-view" (or near `minScale`) image animates its `scale` smoothly to a predefined `intermediateScale`.
* AC2: Double-tapping an already zoomed image (scale > `minScale`) animates its `scale` smoothly back to `minScale` and resets `offsetX` and `offsetY` to `0f`.
* AC3: The zoom transition (animating `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`) triggered by a double-tap is smooth and visually pleasing.
* AC4: (Stretch goal/Refinement) If zooming in via double-tap, the zoom appears to center around the point of the tap, adjusting `offsetX` and `offsetY` accordingly during the animation.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 6.2 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt`
    * _(Hint: `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [160, 176] for double-tap and `docs/coding-standards.md` for animations.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `Modifier.pointerInput`, `detectTapGestures`, `Animatable` (preferred for coordinated animations of scale/offset), `LaunchedEffect` (to trigger animations).
    * Coroutines for managing `Animatable.animateTo`.
    * Calculation of target `offsetX`/`offsetY` for centered zoom based on `tapOffset`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` and Compose Animation documentation.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Existing states: `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`.
    * `Animatable` instances for these states.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Animations should be smooth and use appropriate durations/easing (e.g., `FastOutSlowInEasing`).
    * Ensure double-tap logic correctly toggles between zoom states.
    * Calculations for tap-centered zoom need care to handle offsets correctly relative to the image and view.
    * Refer to "UI Animations and Transitions" in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] In `ImageDetailScreen.kt`, convert `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY` states from `mutableStateOf` to `remember { Animatable(initialValue) }` if not already. The initial value for `scale` should be `minScale` (once calculated).
* [x] Define `intermediateScale` (e.g., `val intermediateScale = (minScale + maxScale) / 2f` or `minScale * 2f`, clamped by `maxScale`).
* [x] Add `detectTapGestures(onDoubleTap = { tapOffset -> ... })` to the `Modifier.pointerInput` chain (it can be combined with `detectTransformGestures`).
* [x] Inside `onDoubleTap` lambda:
    * [x] Launch a coroutine (e.g., `coroutineScope.launch { ... }` if `pointerInput` provides one, or use a `rememberCoroutineScope()` at the Composable level).
    * [x] Get current `scale.value`.
    * [x] **If zooming in (current scale is close to `minScale`):**
        * [x] Calculate target `targetScale = intermediateScale`.
        * [x] (AC4 - Centered Zoom) Calculate target `targetOffsetX` and `targetOffsetY` to center zoom on `tapOffset`. This involves considering the tap point relative to the view, the current translation, and how the scale change affects the perceived origin.
            * `targetOffsetX = (viewWidth / 2f - tapOffset.x) * (targetScale / currentScale - 1) + offsetX.value * (targetScale / currentScale)`
            * `targetOffsetY = (viewHeight / 2f - tapOffset.y) * (targetScale / currentScale - 1) + offsetY.value * (targetScale / currentScale)`
            * (These formulas are examples and may need refinement based on how `graphicsLayer` transformation origins work). Ensure these are then clamped by Story 6.2's boundary logic for the new `targetScale`.
        * [x] Use `coroutineScope.launch { animatableOffsetX.animateTo(targetOffsetX, animationSpec = tween(durationMillis = 300)) }` (and for Y).
        * [x] Use `coroutineScope.launch { animatableScale.animateTo(targetScale, animationSpec = tween(durationMillis = 300)) }`.
    * [x] **If zooming out (current scale > `minScale`):**
        * [x] Target `targetScale = minScale`.
        * [x] Target `targetOffsetX = 0f`.
        * [x] Target `targetOffsetY = 0f`.
        * [x] Animate `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY` to these target values using `animateTo`.
* [x] Ensure animations are interruptible (which `Animatable` supports). If a pinch gesture starts during a double-tap animation, the pinch should take over.
* [x] Test all double-tap scenarios and smoothness.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * If complex calculations for centered zoom offsets are extracted, unit test them thoroughly.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * Simulate double-tap gestures.
    * Verify `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY` animate to expected target values.
    * Check animation smoothness if possible through test framework utilities (though often visual).
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` [Epic 6 points].)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Double-tap an image at its initial "fit-to-view" scale. Verify it smoothly zooms to the intermediate level.
    * AC2: Double-tap the now zoomed-in image. Verify it smoothly zooms out to "fit-to-view" and centers.
    * AC3: Observe the animation quality â€“ it should be smooth without jank.
    * AC4: (If tap-centered zoom implemented) Double-tap different parts of the image when zooming in. Verify the zoom appears to focus on the tapped area.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [176-178].)_
