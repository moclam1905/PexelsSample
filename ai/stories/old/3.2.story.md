# Story 3.2: Image Item Composable & Image Loading

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a thumbnail for each image in the search results, so that I can get a preview of the image content.

**Context:** This story builds directly on Story 3.1, where the structure for displaying search results (`LazyVerticalGrid`) was created. Now, we'll implement the actual `ImageItem` Composable that will load and display each photo using an image loading library (Coil, as per `docs/tech-stack.md`).

## Detailed Requirements

* Create a reusable `ImageItem` Composable that takes a `Photo` domain model object as input.
* The `ImageItem` should display the image using Coil for Jetpack Compose (`io.coil-kt:coil-compose`).
    * Add the Coil dependency if not already present (though `docs/tech-stack.md` lists it, assume it's added now if not before).
    * Load the image from one of the URLs in the `Photo.src` object (e.g., `Photo.src.medium` or `Photo.src.portrait`). `medium` is a good general choice for a grid thumbnail.
* The `ImageItem` should display a placeholder (e.g., a solid color based on `Photo.avg_color`, or a generic placeholder drawable/color) while the image is loading.
* The `ImageItem` should handle image loading failures gracefully (e.g., display an error icon or a different default placeholder).
* Each `ImageItem` should be a reasonable size for a grid/list thumbnail and maintain aspect ratio as much as possible or fill bounds.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: Coil dependency (`io.coil-kt:coil-compose`) is added to `app/build.gradle.kts` (via `libs.versions.toml`).
-   AC2: A reusable `ImageItem(photo: Photo, modifier: Modifier = Modifier)` Composable is created (e.g., in `ui/common/`).
-   AC3: `ImageItem` uses `AsyncImage` (from Coil) to load and display the image from `photo.src.medium`.
-   AC4: While loading, `AsyncImage` displays a placeholder (e.g., a `Box` colored with `photo.avg_color`, or a default gray if color parsing fails).
-   AC5: If image loading fails, `AsyncImage` displays a distinct error placeholder (e.g., an error icon or a different background color).
-   AC6: The `ImageItem` is used within the `LazyVerticalGrid` in `SearchResultsScreen` (replacing the placeholder from Story 3.1). Images are displayed with reasonable quality and performance.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Story 3.1 is complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Create:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt`
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `libs.versions.toml` (if Coil not yet added).
        -   `app/build.gradle.kts` (if Coil not yet added).
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt` (to use `ImageItem`).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` for package locations. `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose best practices.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Coil (`io.coil-kt:coil-compose:${libs.versions.coil.get()}`). Coil's `AsyncImage` Composable.
    -   Jetpack Compose (for structuring `ImageItem`).
    -   `Photo` domain model.
    -   Color parsing (for `Photo.avg_color`).
    -   Material Symbols (for error icon, optional).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for Coil version. `docs/coding-standards.md` for UI component design.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Coil will make HTTP GET requests to image URLs from `Photo.src`.
    -   _(Hint: Image URLs are from Pexels, indirectly from `docs/api-reference.md`.)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Uses `Photo` and `PhotoSrc` domain models.
    -   Coil's `AsyncImagePainter.State` can be used to determine loading/success/error states for placeholders.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   `ImageItem` should be reusable and potentially customizable via `Modifier`.
    -   Use Coil's `AsyncImage` with its `placeholder`, `error`, and `fallback` painters or content slots.
    -   Parse `Photo.avg_color` (String like "#RRGGBB") into a Compose `Color`. Handle potential parsing errors gracefully (e.g., default color).
    -   Image content scaling: `ContentScale.Crop` is often suitable for fixed-size items in a grid to fill bounds.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Add Coil dependency to `libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle.kts` (e.g., `implementation(libs.coil.compose)`). Version `2.7.0` as per `docs/tech-stack.md`.
-   [x] Create `ImageItem.kt` in `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/`.
    -   [x] Define `ImageItem(photo: Photo, modifier: Modifier = Modifier, onItemClick: (Photo) -> Unit)` Composable. (Add `onItemClick` for Story 4.1 later, can be empty for now).
    -   [x] Inside `ImageItem`, use `AsyncImage` from Coil:
        -   [x] `model = photo.src.medium` (or other suitable size like `portrait` or `small`).
        -   [x] `contentDescription = photo.alt` (or a generic description like "Pexels Photo by ${photo.photographer}").
        -   [x] `modifier = modifier.aspectRatio(1f).fillMaxWidth()` (or similar to fit grid cell, e.g. `Modifier.height(180.dp)` if using `GridCells.Adaptive`).
        -   [x] `contentScale = ContentScale.Crop`.
        -   [x] Implement `placeholder`:
            -   [x] Attempt to parse `photo.avg_color` string to `androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color`.
            -   [x] If successful, use `Modifier.background(parsedColor)`. If parsing fails or color is invalid, use a default e.g. `Color.LightGray`.
            -   [x] Can be a simple `Box` with this background.
        -   [x] Implement `error`:
            -   [x] Display an error icon (e.g., `Icons.Filled.BrokenImage`) or a distinct background (e.g., `Color.DarkGray`).
            -   [x] Can be a `Box` with an icon centered.
    -   [x] (Optional) Add a subtle `Card` or `border` around `AsyncImage` for better visual separation.
-   [x] Modify `SearchResultsScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] In the `LazyVerticalGrid`'s `items` block, replace the placeholder `Box` and `Text` with the new `ImageItem(photo = photo, onItemClick = { /* Handle click in Story 4.1 */ })`.
    -   [x] Adjust `ImageItem` modifiers as needed to fit well within the grid cells (e.g., padding).
-   [x] Helper function for parsing color string:
    ```kotlin
    // In a utility file or ImageItem.kt
    fun parseColor(colorString: String): Color {
        return try {
            Color(android.graphics.Color.parseColor(colorString))
        } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
            Color.LightGray // Default color on parsing failure
        }
    }
    ```

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Test the `parseColor` utility function for valid and invalid hex color strings.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later) Verify `AsyncImage` displays content. Verify correct placeholder/error states by controlling network or using Coil's test utilities if available.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Verify Coil dependency added and project builds.
    -   AC2, AC3: Review `ImageItem.kt` code. Run app, perform a search.
    -   AC6: Verify images are displayed in the grid on `SearchResultsScreen`.
    -   AC4: Observe placeholder (average color background or default) while images load. This might be quick on fast networks.
    -   AC5: Test error state:
        -   Temporarily modify an image URL in the `Photo.src` (e.g., in `SearchViewModel` before setting state, or by intercepting with a mock web server if set up) to be invalid.
        -   Verify the error placeholder (icon/different color) is shown for that item.
    -   Confirm images have reasonable quality and the grid scrolls smoothly.
