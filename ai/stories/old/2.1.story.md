# Story 2.1: Search Input Screen/UI

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear and simple interface with a text field and a search button/icon, so that I can easily type my search keywords and initiate an image search.

**Context:** This is the first story in Epic 2 and focuses on creating the user-facing elements for the search functionality. It assumes that basic navigation (Story 1.5) is in place, and the `HomeScreen` can be designated or modified to house this search UI.

## Detailed Requirements

* Create a dedicated Composable screen or a prominent section on an existing screen for image search.
* Include a `TextField` Composable for users to input their search query.
    * The `TextField` should have a placeholder text (e.g., "Search for images...").
    * It should allow users to see the text they are typing.
* Include a `Button` or `IconButton` (e.g., with a search icon) to trigger the search.
* The search screen/UI should be accessible via the navigation setup in Epic 1 (e.g., as the `HomeScreen` or navigable from it). For this story, we'll assume `HomeScreen` (from Story 1.5) will be adapted for this.
* Basic styling should ensure the input field and button are clearly visible and usable, adhering to Material 3 guidelines.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: A Composable UI is present on the `HomeScreen` with a Material 3 `OutlinedTextField` (or similar M3 TextField) for search input and a `Button` or `IconButton` (with a search icon) to initiate search.
-   AC2: The `TextField` displays appropriate placeholder text (e.g., "Search for images...") when empty.
-   AC3: Users can type text into the `TextField`, and the input is visible.
-   AC4: The search button/icon is visible, clickable, and has a clear visual indication of its purpose (e.g., Material Symbols search icon).
-   AC5: The `HomeScreen` containing these elements is the `startDestination` in the navigation graph (as set up in Story 1.5 and `AppNavigation.kt`).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Epic 1 (Project Setup, Navigation, Hilt, Theme) is assumed complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (This will be the primary file for UI implementation).
        -   Potentially `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/Theme.kt` or `Color.kt` if minor theme adjustments are needed for styling.
    -   Files to Create: None, unless a new reusable Composable for the search bar itself is desired (optional for this story).
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` for `ui/home` package. `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose best practices.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Compose (Material 3 components: `OutlinedTextField`, `Button`, `IconButton`, `Icon`).
    -   ViewModel (A `SearchViewModel` will be created in Story 2.2; for this story, the UI can be built with local `remember` state for the text field initially, to be connected to ViewModel later).
    -   Material Symbols for icons (e.g., `androidx.compose.material.icons.Icons.Filled.Search`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for Compose versions. `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose best practices.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable for this story (API call is Story 2.3).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   A local `MutableState<String>` (using `remember { mutableStateOf("") }`) to hold the `TextField`'s current text.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable for this story.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Use Material 3 components.
    -   Ensure `TextField` has a `label` or `placeholder`.
    -   Make UI elements visually clear and interactive.
    -   Follow Composable naming conventions (`PascalCase`).
    -   Adhere to Jetpack Compose best practices for state management (even if local for now) and UI structure as per `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   Consider accessibility: provide content descriptions for IconButtons.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Modify `HomeScreen.kt` in `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/`.
    -   [x] Remove or adapt the placeholder content from Story 1.5.
    -   [x] Add a `Column` or `Row` to arrange the search input and button.
    -   [x] Implement an `OutlinedTextField` Composable:
        -   [x] Use `remember { mutableStateOf("") }` to hold its value.
        -   [x] Set `onValueChange` to update this state.
        -   [x] Provide a `label` (e.g., `Text("Search")`) or `placeholder` (e.g., `Text("Search for images...")`).
        -   [x] Ensure it's appropriately styled (e.g., `modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()`).
    -   [x] Implement a `Button` or `IconButton` next to or below the `TextField`:
        -   [x] If `IconButton`, use `androidx.compose.material.icons.Icons.Filled.Search` as the icon. Provide a content description (e.g., "Search button").
        -   [x] The `onClick` lambda will be empty for now or log a message; it will be connected to ViewModel in Story 2.2.
        -   [x] Ensure basic padding and alignment for a clean look.
-   [x] Verify that `HomeScreen` is the `startDestination` in `AppNavigation.kt` (as set up in Story 1.5).
-   [x] (Optional) If a search icon is used with `TextField` (e.g., `leadingIcon` or `trailingIcon`), ensure it's also from Material Symbols.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Not primary for visual UI elements, but any complex non-UI logic extracted could be unit tested.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written more formally later, but consider these interactions for manual verification now)
    -   Verify the `TextField` exists and can receive input.
    -   Verify the search `Button` or `IconButton` exists and is clickable.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Run the app. Visually inspect `HomeScreen` for the `OutlinedTextField` and search `Button`/`IconButton`.
    -   AC2: Confirm the placeholder text is visible in the empty `TextField`.
    -   AC3: Type text into the `TextField`. Confirm the text appears and is editable.
    -   AC4: Confirm the search button/icon is present, looks like a search trigger, and is clickable (even if it does nothing yet).
    -   AC5: Confirm `HomeScreen` is the first screen shown on app launch.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
