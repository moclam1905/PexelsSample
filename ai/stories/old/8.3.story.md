# Story 8.3: Visual Feedback and State Handling for Pull-to-Refresh

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I perform a pull-to-refresh, I want to see a clear visual indicator that the app is working and be informed if the refresh is successful or fails.

**Context:** This story ensures the UI correctly reflects the states managed by `SearchViewModel` during a pull-to-refresh operation (Story 8.1, 8.2). It focuses on the `PullToRefreshIndicator` behavior and how errors during refresh are communicated. This aligns with PRD v1.1 [317].

## Detailed Requirements

* The `PullToRefreshIndicator` (or equivalent from `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh`) in `SearchResultsListComposable` (or its host) should be displayed and animated correctly based on the `isRefreshing` state from `SearchViewModel` and the user's pull gesture state (managed by `rememberPullToRefreshState`).
* If the refresh operation in `SearchViewModel` fails (e.g., network error, API error, leading to `errorState` being set):
    * The UI should display this error. A `Snackbar` or `Toast` is suitable for transient errors during refresh if main content might still be visible. If the error should replace content, the existing `ErrorView` (from Story 5.1) mechanism can be used, but it might be too intrusive if old data is still on screen. *Decision: For refresh errors, if `photos` list is not empty (showing stale data), show a `Snackbar`. If `photos` list becomes empty due to error or was empty, can use `ErrorView`.*
* `SearchViewModel.isRefreshing` must be set to `false` after the error is processed, ensuring the refresh indicator is hidden.
* Upon successful refresh, new data should seamlessly replace or update the content in the `LazyVerticalGrid`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [x] AC1: The `PullToRefreshIndicator` is visible and animating correctly during the pull gesture and while `SearchViewModel.isRefreshing` is true.
* [x] AC2: The `PullToRefreshIndicator` is hidden when `SearchViewModel.isRefreshing` is false (after success or error).
* [x] AC3: New data (or reloaded first page) is displayed in the `LazyVerticalGrid` upon successful refresh, replacing old content.
* [x] AC4: In case of a refresh error:
    * [x] An appropriate error message is shown to the user (e.g., `Snackbar` if old data is present, or `ErrorView` if the screen becomes effectively empty/error-only).
    * [x] The refresh indicator stops/hides.
* [x] AC5: The UI remains responsive during and after the refresh operation.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Stories 8.1 and 8.2 are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (or its host like `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt`).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt` (to ensure error state handling for refresh is robust).
        * `MainActivity.kt` or root Composable if `SnackbarHostState` needs to be provided globally.
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [213-216, 224-225] for UI feedback.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `PullToRefreshIndicator`, `PullToRefreshState`, `SnackbarHost`, `SnackbarHostState`, conditional UI logic.
    * `SearchViewModel` states: `isRefreshing`, `errorState`, `photos`.
    * Coroutines (`LaunchedEffect` for showing Snackbar).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Relies on `SearchViewModel`'s interaction with repository for refresh.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Existing ViewModel states.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Error display for refresh should be less intrusive if stale data is still useful. Snackbar is good for this.
    * Ensure state transitions for `isRefreshing` are correctly tied to the indicator's visibility.
    * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Verify `PullToRefreshIndicator` behavior in `SearchResultsListComposable` (or host):**
    * [ ] Ensure `PullToRefreshIndicator`'s `refreshing` parameter is correctly bound to `viewModel.isRefreshing.collectAsStateWithLifecycle().value`.
    * [ ] Ensure `PullToRefreshBox`'s `isRefreshing` (or equivalent parameter based on library version) is also bound correctly, and `onRefresh` lambda calls `viewModel.onRefreshTriggered()`.
* [ ] **Implement Snackbar for refresh errors in `SearchResultsListComposable` (or host):**
    * [ ] Add `SnackbarHostState`: `val snackbarHostState = remember { SnackbarHostState() }`.
    * [ ] Add `SnackbarHost(hostState = snackbarHostState, modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.BottomCenter))` inside the `PullToRefreshBox` or `Scaffold` if used.
    * [ ] Collect `errorState` from `SearchViewModel`.
    * [ ] Use `LaunchedEffect(viewModel.errorState)` to show a Snackbar when a refresh-specific error occurs:
      ```kotlin
      // LaunchedEffect(viewModel.errorState.value) { // Be careful with re-triggering
      //     viewModel.errorState.value?.let { error ->
      //         // Only show snackbar if it's a new error related to refresh and photos are present
      //         if (photosList.isNotEmpty() && error.isFromRefresh) { // Need a way to distinguish error source
      //             snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(
      //                 message = error.message,
      //                 duration = SnackbarDuration.Short
      //             )
      //             viewModel.clearErrorState() // Important to prevent re-showing
      //         }
      //     }
      // }
      ```
      *Refinement: `SearchViewModel` could expose a separate error channel/event `Flow` specifically for transient errors like refresh failures to simplify Snackbar triggering and avoid issues with `StateFlow` re-collection.*
      *Alternative for distinguishing error: If `_errorState` is set during refresh while `_photos` is not empty, the UI can infer it's a refresh error suitable for a Snackbar.*
* [ ] **Update `SearchViewModel.kt` for error handling during refresh:**
    * [ ] When setting `_errorState.value` after a failed refresh, ensure the message is appropriate.
    * [ ] Ensure `_isRefreshing.value` is set to `false` in the `finally` block even if an error occurred.
* [ ] **Conditional display of `ErrorView` vs. content:**
    * If refresh fails AND `_photos.value` becomes empty (or was already empty), `ErrorView` should be shown as the primary content (logic from Story 5.1 and 5.2 would handle this if `errorState` is set).
* [ ] Test visual states thoroughly.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    * Verify `isRefreshing` is set to `false` in `finally` block after mocked refresh errors.
    * Verify `errorState` is appropriately set for refresh failures.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later)
    * Test pull-to-refresh gesture: verify indicator appears/animates.
    * Mock ViewModel to set `isRefreshing = true`, verify indicator. Set to `false`, verify it hides.
    * Mock ViewModel to emit an error state after a refresh attempt. Verify Snackbar appears (if conditions met) or `ErrorView` appears.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Perform pull-to-refresh. Observe indicator animation during pull and while `isRefreshing` is true (use logs/debugger in VM).
    * AC2: After refresh completes (success/error), verify indicator hides.
    * AC3: On successful refresh, confirm `LazyVerticalGrid` updates with new data.
    * AC4: Simulate a refresh error (e.g., airplane mode, then refresh):
        * If old data is on screen, verify a Snackbar appears with the error.
        * If the screen was empty or becomes empty due to error, verify `ErrorView` might be shown.
        * Verify refresh indicator hides.
    * AC5: Ensure UI is responsive during these operations.
