# Story 1.5: Basic Navigation Structure with Jetpack Compose

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want a basic navigation graph set up using Jetpack Navigation Component for Compose, so that the app can navigate between different screens (even if they are placeholders initially).

**Context:** This story introduces screen navigation using Jetpack Navigation Compose, a fundamental part of a multi-screen app. It builds upon the initial project setup (Story 1.1).

## Detailed Requirements

* Add Jetpack Navigation Compose dependency.
* Define a `NavHost` and a `NavController`.
* Create at least two placeholder Composable screens:
    * An initial screen (e.g., `HomeScreen`).
    * A placeholder for search results (e.g., `SearchResultsScreen`).
* Implement navigation from the initial screen to the placeholder search results screen (e.g., on a button click).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: Jetpack Navigation Compose dependency (`androidx.navigation:navigation-compose`) is added via `libs.versions.toml`.
-   AC2: A `NavHost` is set up in `MainActivity` (or a root Composable like `AppNavigation`) with at least two Composable destinations (`HomeScreen`, `SearchResultsScreen`) defined with unique string routes.
-   AC3: User can navigate from `HomeScreen` to `SearchResultsScreen` via a UI interaction (e.g., button).
-   AC4: System back press from `SearchResultsScreen` returns to `HomeScreen`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Create:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/ScreenRoutes.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt`
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `libs.versions.toml` (add navigation-compose).
        -   `app/build.gradle.kts` (implement navigation-compose).
        -   `MainActivity.kt` (to host `AppNavigation`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for package locations)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Navigation Compose (`libs.androidx.navigation.compose`).
    -   Jetpack Compose (`NavController`, `NavHost`, `composable`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for versions)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   String constants for navigation routes (in `ScreenRoutes.kt`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Navigation routes as string constants in a dedicated file/object.
    -   `NavHost` as central navigation manager.
    -   Keep placeholder screens simple.
    -   Follow Jetpack Compose best practices from `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Add `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose` to `libs.versions.toml` and implement in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
-   [x] Create `ScreenRoutes.kt` in `core/navigation/` defining `HOME` and `SEARCH_RESULTS` route constants.
-   [x] Create placeholder `HomeScreen.kt` in `ui/home/` with a Text and a Button to navigate to `ScreenRoutes.SEARCH_RESULTS`.
-   [x] Create placeholder `SearchResultsScreen.kt` in `ui/results/` with a Text and a Button to navigate back (e.g., `navController.popBackStack()`).
-   [x] Create `AppNavigation.kt` in `core/navigation/` with `NavHost`, `rememberNavController()`, and composable destinations for `HomeScreen` and `SearchResultsScreen`, starting at `ScreenRoutes.HOME`.
-   [x] Modify `MainActivity.kt` to set its content to `PexelsSampleTheme { AppNavigation() }`.
-   [x] Build and run.

## Testing Requirements

-   Test that the app can navigate between `HomeScreen` and `SearchResultsScreen` via a UI interaction.
-   Test that the system back press from `SearchResultsScreen` returns to `HomeScreen`.
