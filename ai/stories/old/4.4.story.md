# Story 4.4: Display Image Metadata

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, on the image detail screen, I want to see information about the image, such as the photographer's name, so that I can learn more about its origin.

**Context:** This story completes the `ImageDetailScreen` by ensuring all required metadata (photographer name, alt text) is displayed clearly. It builds upon Story 4.2 (UI Layout) and Story 4.3 (Image Display). Optional: make photographer URL clickable.

## Detailed Requirements

* Display the photographer's name (`Photo.photographer`) using a `Text` Composable.
* Display the image's alternative text (`Photo.alt`) if available and non-empty, using a `Text` Composable. This can serve as a description.
* (Optional for MVP, but good if simple) Make the photographer's name clickable to open their Pexels profile URL (`Photo.photographerUrl`) in a web browser (using an Intent). *Decision: Implement this if straightforward.*
* (Optional for MVP) Display the original image dimensions (`Photo.width`, `Photo.height`) if desired. *Decision: Defer this unless very simple.*

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: The photographer's name from `photo.photographer` is displayed as a `Text` Composable on `ImageDetailScreen`.
-   AC2: The image's alt text from `photo.alt` is displayed as a `Text` Composable, only if `photo.alt` is not blank.
-   AC3: (If implemented) The photographer's name `Text` is clickable. Clicking it launches an `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` with `photo.photographerUrl` to open it in a browser.
-   AC4: Displayed metadata is clearly legible and styled appropriately (e.g., using `MaterialTheme.typography`).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Story 4.3 is complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt`
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md` for Compose.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Jetpack Compose (`Text`, `ClickableText` or `Modifier.clickable`, `LocalUriHandler` or `Context.startActivity` with `Intent`).
    -   `Photo` domain model.
    -   Android `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` and `Uri.parse()` for opening URL.
    -   `LocalUriHandler.current` for a more Compose-idiomatic way to open URLs.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   Relies on `photo: Photo?` state.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Ensure text is styled for readability using `MaterialTheme.typography`.
    -   Handle click for URL opening carefully (use `LocalUriHandler` for preference).
    -   Conditionally display alt text.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] Modify `ImageDetailScreen.kt`:
    -   [x] Ensure `Text` Composables for photographer name and alt text (from Story 4.2) are correctly bound to `photo.photographer` and `photo.alt`.
        -   Photographer: `Text("Photo by: ${photo.photographer}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium)`
        -   Alt text: `if (photo.alt.isNotBlank()) { Text("Description: ${photo.alt}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium) }`
    -   [x] (Implement AC3 - Clickable Photographer URL)
        -   Import `androidx.compose.ui.platform.LocalUriHandler`.
        -   Get `val uriHandler = LocalUriHandler.current`.
        -   Modify the `Text` Composable for the photographer's name:
            ```kotlin
            // if (photo != null) {
            //    val photographerText = "Photo by: ${photo.photographer}"
            //    Text(
            //        text = photographerText,
            //        style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium,
            //        color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary, // Indicate it's clickable
            //        modifier = Modifier.clickable(
            //            enabled = photo.photographerUrl.isNotBlank(),
            //            onClick = { uriHandler.openUri(photo.photographerUrl) }
            //        )
            //    )
            //}
            ```
            Or, use an `AnnotatedString` with `ClickableText` for more control if only part of the text should be clickable or styled differently. For simplicity, making the whole text clickable if URL exists is fine.
    -   [x] Apply appropriate `Modifier.padding` or `Spacer` between metadata elements for clarity.
    -   [x] Review styling of the text elements using `MaterialTheme.typography` (e.g., `titleMedium` for photographer, `bodyMedium` for description).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Not primary for UI text display.
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later) Verify `Text` elements display correct metadata. Verify click on photographer name (if implemented) attempts to open URL (can be checked with Espresso Intents or UI Automator if testing actual intent launch is needed, or mock `UriHandler`).
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Navigate to `ImageDetailScreen`. Verify photographer's name is displayed correctly.
    -   AC2: Verify alt text/description is displayed if present in `photo.alt`, and hidden if blank.
    -   AC3 (If implemented): Click on the photographer's name. Verify it attempts to open the `photographerUrl` in a web browser.
    -   AC4: Visually inspect that metadata text is clear, legible, and well-styled.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for testing approaches.)_
