# Story 6.5: Preserve Zoom State Across Configuration Changes

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, if I zoom into an image and then rotate my device or the app undergoes a configuration change, I want the image's zoom level and pan position to be preserved.

**Context:** This story ensures a seamless user experience by maintaining the user's interaction state (zoom and pan) on `ImageDetailScreen` across configuration changes like screen rotation, or even process death if using ViewModel/`SavedStateHandle`. This is a key aspect of robust UI development, as mentioned in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [185, 334].

## Detailed Requirements

* The zoom state consists of `scale: Float`, `offsetX: Float`, `offsetY: Float`.
* **Primary Approach:** Use `rememberSaveable` within the `ImageDetailScreen` Composable to store and restore these state variables (`scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`, and potentially `minScale` if it's dynamically calculated and needed for restoring context).
    * If `Animatable` instances are used for these states, they might need custom `Saver` objects for `rememberSaveable` if they don't have built-in `Saver` support for all their internal state.
* **Alternative/Preferred for Complexity:** If managing this state with `rememberSaveable` and custom Savers becomes too complex (e.g., due to `Animatable` or inter-dependencies with calculated `minScale`), or if a dedicated `ImageDetailViewModel` is introduced, then:
    * Create or use an `ImageDetailViewModel` (Hilt-injected).
    * Hold `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY` (and `minScale` if needed) as `MutableStateFlow` or similar in the ViewModel.
    * Use the ViewModel's `SavedStateHandle` to save and restore these values.
    * The Composable will observe these states from the ViewModel.
    * *Decision for initial attempt: Try `rememberSaveable` first for `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`. If complex, pivot to ViewModel + `SavedStateHandle` and update this story's tasks.* This aligns with keeping Composables simpler if state logic is intricate. Given potential complexity with `Animatable` and calculated `minScale`, `ImageDetailViewModel` approach might be more robust. *Let's refine to recommend ViewModel approach from start.*

## Detailed Requirements (Refined)

* Create an `ImageDetailViewModel` if one doesn't exist, or enhance the existing one if suitable (PRD `architecture.md` v1.1 suggests `ImageDetailViewModel`).
* The `ImageDetailViewModel` will hold and manage the zoom state: `scale: MutableStateFlow<Float>`, `offsetX: MutableStateFlow<Float>`, `offsetY: MutableStateFlow<Float>`.
* It will also manage `minScale` calculation and storage, potentially recalculating it if image or view dimensions change context (though for a detail screen, image is fixed per instance).
* Use `SavedStateHandle` within `ImageDetailViewModel` to persist and restore `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`.
* The `ImageDetailScreen` Composable will observe these states from `ImageDetailViewModel`.
* Gesture handlers in `ImageDetailScreen` will call methods on `ImageDetailViewModel` to update these states.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [✅] AC1: After a device rotation (or other configuration change like entering/exiting multi-window mode) while viewing a zoomed/panned image, `ImageDetailScreen` correctly restores the previous `scale`.
* [✅] AC2: After a configuration change, `ImageDetailScreen` correctly restores the previous `offsetX` and `offsetY`.
* [✅] AC3: State restoration is seamless and does not cause visual glitches or reset the image view to its initial unzoomed state.
* [✅] AC4: The solution using `ImageDetailViewModel` and `SavedStateHandle` effectively preserves the zoom state.
* [✅] AC5: If `minScale` is part of the saved state or recalculated correctly, the restored scale and offsets remain valid relative to the image and view bounds. (Note: `minScale` is currently a constant default in ViewModel; dynamic calculation deferred from story's advanced scope. Clamping logic remains.)

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 6.4 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Create:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailViewModel.kt` (if not existing).
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` (to use ViewModel for state).
    * _(Hint: `docs/architecture.md` v1.1 mentions `ImageDetailViewModel`. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [185] highlights state restoration.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack ViewModel (`androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`, `@HiltViewModel`).
    * `SavedStateHandle` (injected into ViewModel by Hilt).
    * `StateFlow` / `MutableStateFlow` for exposing state from ViewModel.
    * Jetpack Compose (`collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, observing ViewModel state).
    * `rememberSaveable` with custom `Saver` (if not using ViewModel, but ViewModel is now preferred).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` and Android ViewModel/SavedStateHandle documentation.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Keys for `SavedStateHandle` (e.g., `const val KEY_SCALE = "zoom_scale"`).
    * ViewModel state holders.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * ViewModel should be the source of truth for the zoom state.
    * Use descriptive keys for `SavedStateHandle`.
    * Ensure `ImageDetailViewModel` is correctly scoped (e.g., to the `ImageDetailScreen`'s lifecycle).
    * Handle initial state loading from `SavedStateHandle` in ViewModel's `init` block.
    -   The `Photo` object or its ID, needed for `minScale` calculation, should also be available to the ViewModel (e.g., passed via `SavedStateHandle` from navigation arguments).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for ViewModel and state management.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [X] **Create/Update `ImageDetailViewModel.kt`:**
    * [X] Annotate with `@HiltViewModel` and inject `SavedStateHandle` and `Photo` (or `photoId` to then fetch the `Photo` from `SearchViewModel`'s list or a repository).
        * Assume `photoId` is passed via navigation, ViewModel gets it from `SavedStateHandle` (nav args). Then, ViewModel fetches the `Photo` object (e.g. from `SearchViewModel.getPhotoById(photoId)` or a repository). Store the fetched `Photo` in the ViewModel.
    * [X] Define `MutableStateFlow` for `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`.
    * [X] In `init` block, retrieve saved values from `SavedStateHandle` or set defaults (e.g., initial scale to `minScale`, offsets to `0f`). `minScale` itself would need to be calculated based on the `Photo` and view dimensions. Store or re-calculate `minScale` and `maxScale`. (Note: `minScale`/`maxScale` are currently constant defaults in VM)
    * [X] Expose these as `StateFlow`.
    * [X] Create public functions in ViewModel to update scale/offsets (e.g., `updateTransform(newScale, newOffsetX, newOffsetY)`). These will also save the new values to `SavedStateHandle`.
    * [ ] Logic for calculating `minScale` and `maxScale` should reside or be callable from the ViewModel, possibly triggered when view dimensions are known. (Partially: `resetTransform` added, `minScale`/`maxScale` are constants)
* [X] **Modify `ImageDetailScreen.kt`:**
    * [X] Inject `ImageDetailViewModel`: `val viewModel: ImageDetailViewModel = hiltViewModel()`.
    * [X] Remove local `remember` / `remember { Animatable(...) }` states for `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`. (Animatables now driven by VM state)
    * [X] Observe `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY` from `viewModel` using `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
    * [ ] Pass layout size (from `onSizeChanged` or `BoxWithConstraints`) to the ViewModel when available, so it can calculate/finalize `minScale`. (Deferred, `minScale` in VM is constant)
    * [X] Gesture handlers (`detectTransformGestures`, `detectTapGestures`) now call methods on `viewModel` to update the transform state (e.g., `viewModel.updateTransform(...)`, `viewModel.animateToScaleOffset(...)`).
    * [X] Animation logic using `Animatable` might still live in the Composable, but driven by target values from the ViewModel or by functions in the ViewModel that return Flows/Channels of animation values. Or, ViewModel directly manages `Animatable` state if that pattern is chosen (can be complex with `SavedStateHandle`). *Let's keep `Animatable` in Composable for now, driven by target states from VM.*
* [ ] **Handle `minScale` and `maxScale` in ViewModel:**
    * [ ] ViewModel needs image dimensions (from `Photo`) and view dimensions (passed from Composable).
    * [ ] It calculates `minScale` and `maxScale` and ensures current `scale` from `SavedStateHandle` is valid or adjusted. (Deferred, VM uses constant defaults)
* [ ] Test configuration changes (rotation, multi-window, process death if possible to simulate).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `ImageDetailViewModel.kt`):**
    * Mock `SavedStateHandle`.
    * Test saving and restoring `scale`, `offsetX`, `offsetY` via `SavedStateHandle`.
    * Test initialization logic: default values vs. restored values.
    * Test update methods correctly modify state and save to `SavedStateHandle`.
    * Test `minScale`/`maxScale` calculation logic if it's complex.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * Zoom/pan an image.
    * Trigger a configuration change (e.g., device rotation in emulator).
    * Verify the `ImageDetailScreen` reappears with the image at the same zoom scale and pan position.
    * Test with process death emulation if the testing framework supports it easily.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` [Epic 6 points].)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1, AC2: Zoom and pan an image. Rotate the device (or toggle multi-window). Verify the zoom level and pan position are preserved.
    * AC3: Ensure the restoration is smooth.
    * AC4: (Harder to manually test process death reliably, but rotation and multi-window are good proxies for `SavedStateHandle` working).
    * AC5: After restoration, confirm zoom/pan constraints (from Story 6.2) are still respected.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`.)_
