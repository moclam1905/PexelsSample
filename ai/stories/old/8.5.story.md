# Story 8.5: Display Recent Searches UI

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I focus on the search bar and it's empty, I want to see a list of my recent searches, so I can quickly select one without retyping.

**Context:** This story builds on the DataStore setup (Story 8.4) to display the saved search history to the user. It involves `SearchViewModel` fetching this history and the UI (likely `HomeScreen` or a component within it) rendering it conditionally. This implements PRD v1.1 [318].

## Detailed Requirements

* In `SearchViewModel`, add state for `recentSearches: StateFlow<List<String>>` (initially empty) and `showRecentSearchesSuggestions: StateFlow<Boolean>` (initially false).
* When the `SearchBar` Composable (e.g., on `HomeScreen`) is focused AND its input text is empty:
    * `SearchViewModel` should be notified (e.g., via a new method `onSearchBarFocusChanged(isFocused: Boolean, currentQuery: String)`).
    * If focused and query is empty, ViewModel fetches recent searches from `SearchHistoryRepository` (e.g., `getRecentSearches(limit = MAX_HISTORY_SIZE)`).
    * Update `_recentSearches.value` and set `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value = true` if history is not empty.
* The UI (`HomeScreen` or a dedicated `SearchSuggestionsComposable`) should render the `recentSearches` list (e.g., using `LazyColumn`) displayed conditionally below or near the search bar when `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` is true.
* Limit the number of displayed searches (e.g., `SearchHistoryKeys.MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 10` from Story 8.4).
* Order terms with the most recently added/searched at the top (repository should handle this ordering).
* If history is empty, `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value` should remain `false` or the UI should show an appropriate "No recent searches" message within the suggestions area.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* [x] AC1: `SearchViewModel` exposes `recentSearches: StateFlow<List<String>>` and `showRecentSearchesSuggestions: StateFlow<Boolean>`.
* [x] AC2: When the search TextField (part of `SearchBar`) on `HomeScreen` receives focus and is empty, `SearchViewModel` fetches recent searches, and `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` becomes true if history is not empty.
* [x] AC3: A list of up to `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE` recent search terms is displayed below/near the search bar when `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` is true. Terms are ordered with the most recent at the top.
* [x] AC4: If no search history exists, the recent searches UI is not shown, or it displays a "No recent searches" message.
* [x] AC5: The recent searches UI is hidden (`showRecentSearchesSuggestions` becomes false) when the search bar loses focus or when text is entered into it.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Story 8.4 is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Create:
        * Potentially `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchSuggestionsComposable.kt` (if UI is complex).
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (or where SearchBar is implemented).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/SearchBar.kt` (if SearchBar is a reusable common component, it needs to report focus changes).
    * _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md` v1.1. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [239-242] for UI patterns.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * `SearchViewModel`, `StateFlow`, Kotlin Coroutines (`viewModelScope`, `collectLatest`).
    * `SearchHistoryRepository`.
    * Jetpack Compose (`LazyColumn`, `TextField` focus state `InteractionSource` or `onFocusChanged` modifier, conditional rendering).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Uses `SearchHistoryRepository` to fetch local data.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * ViewModel states for `recentSearches` list and `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` boolean.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` v1.1.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Logic for showing/hiding suggestions should be robust.
    * `LazyColumn` for displaying history items.
    * Ensure efficient observation of focus and text input state.
    * Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [x] **Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:**
    * [x] Add `private val _recentSearches = MutableStateFlow<List<String>>(emptyList())`.
    * [x] Add `val recentSearches: StateFlow<List<String>> = _recentSearches.asStateFlow()`.
    * [x] Add `private val _showRecentSearchesSuggestions = MutableStateFlow(false)`.
    * [x] Add `val showRecentSearchesSuggestions: StateFlow<Boolean> = _showRecentSearchesSuggestions.asStateFlow()`.
    * [x] Inject `SearchHistoryRepository` (or `GetRecentSearchesUseCase`).
    * [x] Create `fun onSearchQueryChanged(query: String)` (if not already fine-tuned from MVP). This updates `_searchQuery`. If `query` is empty AND search bar is focused, trigger fetch history. If `query` is not empty, set `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value = false`. (Implemented via `combine` operator logic reacting to `_searchQuery` and `_isSearchBarFocused`)
    * [x] Create `fun onSearchBarFocusChanged(isFocused: Boolean)`:
        * [x] If `isFocused` and `_searchQuery.value.isBlank()`:
            * [x] `viewModelScope.launch { searchHistoryRepository.getRecentSearches(MAX_HISTORY_SIZE).collectLatest { history -> _recentSearches.value = history; _showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value = history.isNotEmpty() } }` (Implemented via `combine` operator logic)
        * [x] If `!isFocused`: `_showRecentSearchesSuggestions.value = false`. (Implemented via `combine` operator logic)
* [x] **Modify `SearchBar` Composable (e.g., in `HomeScreen.kt` or `ui/common/SearchBar.kt`):**
    * [x] The `TextField` within the `SearchBar` needs to report focus changes and text changes to the `SearchViewModel`.
        * [x] Use `Modifier.onFocusChanged { focusState -> viewModel.onSearchBarFocusChanged(focusState.isFocused) }`.
        * [x] `onValueChange` should call `viewModel.onSearchQueryChanged(newText)` and also `viewModel.onSearchBarFocusChanged(true)` if `newText` is empty (to re-trigger history if user clears text while focused). (First part done. Second part for `onSearchBarFocusChanged(true)` is implicitly handled by the `combine` operator in VM reacting to empty query + focus).
* [x] **Modify `HomeScreen.kt` (or where `SearchBar` and suggestions are displayed):**
    * [x] Collect `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` and `recentSearches` states from `SearchViewModel`.
    * [x] Conditionally display a `LazyColumn` below the `SearchBar` when `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` is true and `recentSearches` is not empty:
        * [x] Each item in `LazyColumn` should be a `Text(term)` perhaps with an icon (e.g., `Icons.Outlined.History`).
        * [x] Make items clickable (Story 8.6). (Implemented as per this story's task list)
    * [x] If `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` is true and `recentSearches` *is* empty, display a "No recent searches" `Text` message in the suggestions area.
* [x] Style the suggestions list appropriately (padding, item appearance). (Basic styling implemented)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    * Mock `SearchHistoryRepository`.
    * Test `onSearchBarFocusChanged`:
        * Verify `getRecentSearches` is called when focused and query is empty.
        * Verify `recentSearches` and `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` states are updated correctly based on repository response (empty/non-empty history).
        * Verify `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` is false when not focused or query is not empty.
    * Test `onSearchQueryChanged`:
        * Verify `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` becomes false if query becomes non-empty.
        * Verify it potentially re-triggers history fetch if query becomes empty while focused.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later)
    * Test focusing the empty search bar: mock repository to return history, verify suggestions list appears. Mock empty history, verify "no recent" or hidden.
    * Test typing text hides suggestions. Clearing text while focused shows suggestions. Losing focus hides suggestions.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 for UI tests for search history.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1: Review ViewModel code for new states.
    * AC2: Prerequisite: Add some search terms using `SearchHistoryRepository` (e.g., via a temporary test button or by completing Story 8.6 first for adding terms). Tap into the empty search bar. Verify `showRecentSearchesSuggestions` becomes true (use logs/debugger in VM or wait for UI).
    * AC3: Verify the list of recent searches appears below the search bar, ordered correctly.
    * AC4: Clear history (via Story 8.6 mechanism or test setup). Focus empty search bar. Verify "No recent searches" message or suggestions area is hidden.
    * AC5: Verify suggestions hide when typing into search bar or when search bar loses focus.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [239-246].)_
*Suggestion:** Investigate the correct Truth API usage for asserting collection emptiness for a `List<T>` within the `app.cash.turbine.test` scope, or check for potential Truth import/configuration issues in the test environment. A standard Kotlin `assertThat(list.isEmpty()).isTrue()` might be a temporary workaround if direct Truth collection assertions are problematic.
