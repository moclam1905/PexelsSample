# Story 9.2: Animate Image Loading and Appearance in Results Grid

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when images load into the search results grid, I want them to appear smoothly with a subtle animation (e.g., fade-in), rather than abruptly popping in, enhancing the visual flow.

**Context:** This story focuses on adding subtle animations to the `ImageItem` Composables within the `LazyVerticalGrid` on `SearchResultsScreen` (or `SearchResultsListComposable`). As images are loaded by Coil, they should fade in gracefully. This improves perceived performance and visual appeal, as per PRD v1.1 [322] and research [266].

## Detailed Requirements

* For each `ImageItem` in the `LazyVerticalGrid` (in `SearchResultsListComposable`):
    * When using Coil's `AsyncImage` to load the image (from Story 3.2):
        * Leverage Coil's built-in transition capabilities by providing a `Transition.Factory` to the `AsyncImage`. The `CrossfadeTransition.Factory` is a good default.
        * `AsyncImage(model = ..., contentDescription = ..., transitionFactory = CrossfadeTransition.Factory(durationMillis = 300, preferExactIntrinsicSize = true))`
    * Alternatively, if more control is needed than Coil's built-in transitions, wrap the `AsyncImage` (once successfully loaded) in an `AnimatedVisibility` Composable that becomes visible with a fade-in transition. Coil's `onSuccess` callback for `AsyncImagePainter.State` can trigger this visibility. *Decision: Prioritize Coil's built-in `CrossfadeTransition.Factory` for simplicity and integration.*
* The animation duration should be brief and subtle (e.g., 200-300ms).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Images displayed via `AsyncImage` in the results grid (`ImageItem`) fade in smoothly using Coil's `CrossfadeTransition.Factory` (or equivalent) as they are successfully loaded.
* AC2: The fade-in animation has a subtle duration (e.g., 200-300ms) and does not feel distracting or slow down perceived loading.
* AC3: Placeholders (from Story 3.2, e.g., `avg_color` background) are shown correctly before the image successfully loads and the fade-in animation starts.
* AC4: The performance of the `LazyVerticalGrid` remains smooth during scrolling, image loading, and animation of multiple items.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Epic 3 (specifically Story 3.2 for `ImageItem`) is complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt` (where `AsyncImage` is used).
    * _(Hint: `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [266] for image loading animations. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for UI Animations.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Coil for Jetpack Compose: `AsyncImage`, `coil.transition.CrossfadeTransition` / `Transition.Factory`.
    * Jetpack Compose.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1, ensure Coil version supports `transitionFactory`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Relies on Coil's image loading.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Not applicable directly.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Use the recommended Coil API for transitions.
    * Keep animation duration short and subtle.
    * Test performance with many items loading in the grid.
    * Adhere to "UI Animations and Transitions" in `docs/coding-standards.md` (v1.1).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] In `ImageItem.kt`, locate the `AsyncImage` Composable.
* [ ] Modify the `AsyncImage` call to include the `transitionFactory` parameter:
    ```kotlin
    import coil.compose.AsyncImage
    import coil.transition.CrossfadeTransition

    // ... inside ImageItem Composable ...
    AsyncImage(
        model = photo.src.medium, // Or other appropriate URL
        contentDescription = photo.alt.ifBlank { /* ... */ },
        // ... other existing parameters like modifier, contentScale, placeholder, error ...
        transitionFactory = { _, _ -> CrossfadeTransition.Factory().create(CrossfadeTransition.Builder().durationMillis(300).preferExactIntrinsicSize(true)) }
        // Or simpler if defaults are fine for CrossfadeTransition.Factory():
        // transitionFactory = { _, _ -> CrossfadeTransition.Factory() } 
        // Check Coil's documentation for the most current/idiomatic way to apply a simple crossfade.
        // As of some Coil versions, it might be:
        // transition = CrossfadeTransition.Factory()
        // Or if using an explicit builder:
        // transitionFactory = { _, result ->
        //    CrossfadeTransition(result, CrossfadeTransition.Builder().durationMillis(300).build())
        // }
        // Consult latest Coil docs for `io.coil-kt:coil-compose:2.7.0`
    )
    ```
    *Update based on `coil-compose:2.7.0` documentation: The `transitionFactory` parameter is the way to go.
    `transitionFactory = { _, result -> CrossfadeTransition(result, durationMillis = 300) }` might be a common pattern.*

* **Final check on Coil `2.7.0` transition API (example):**
    ```kotlin
    import coil.compose.AsyncImage
    import coil.transition.CrossfadeTransition

    // In ImageItem.kt
    AsyncImage(
        model = photo.src.medium,
        contentDescription = photo.alt.ifBlank { "Photo by ${photo.photographer}" },
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().aspectRatio(1f), // Example
        contentScale = ContentScale.Crop,
        placeholder = painter { /* your placeholder painter, e.g., ColorPainter(parseColor(photo.avgColor)) */ },
        error = painter { /* your error painter */ },
        transitionFactory = { _, result ->
            CrossfadeTransition(result. mémoire(), durationMillis = 300, preferExactIntrinsicSize = true)
        }
    )
    ```
    *(Note: `result.mémoire()` might be a typo and should be `result.memoryCacheKey` or simply `result` depending on what the factory expects for target. The critical part is `CrossfadeTransition(..., durationMillis = 300)`.)*
    The `CrossfadeTransition.Factory` is simpler:
    `transitionFactory = CrossfadeTransition.Factory(durationMillis = 300, preferExactIntrinsicSize = true)`
    *If `CrossfadeTransition.Factory()` is a direct composable or parameter, use that. If it needs to be a lambda returning a factory, adapt. Let's assume the simpler factory constructor passing.*
    Correct way with Coil 2.x for `AsyncImage`:
    ```kotlin
     AsyncImage(
         // ...
         transition = CrossfadeTransition.Factory(durationMillis = 300) // This is simpler if available
         // OR if transitionFactory is needed:
         // transitionFactory = { _, _ -> CrossfadeTransition.Builder().durationMillis(300).build() } // if Builder is part of public API
     )
    ```
    Given Coil's evolution, the exact syntax for `transitionFactory` or a direct `transition` parameter should be verified against `io.coil-kt:coil-compose:2.7.0` documentation. The PRD mentions "fade-in for loaded images", so `CrossfadeTransition` is appropriate.

* [ ] Test by scrolling through `SearchResultsScreen` with images loading. Observe the fade-in effect.
* [ ] Verify performance and ensure no jank is introduced.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not applicable for verifying visual animation directly.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (Challenging to assert animations directly) Tests could verify that `AsyncImage` is configured with a transition, if inspectable. Main verification is manual.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
    * AC1, AC2: Run app, search for images. As images load into the grid, verify they fade in smoothly rather than popping in. Check the duration feels appropriate (not too slow, not too fast).
    * AC3: Verify placeholders are visible before the fade-in starts.
    * AC4: Scroll quickly through a large list of results. Ensure the grid remains responsive and animations don't cause stuttering.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [266].)_
