# Story 7.4: Responsive Sizing for UI Elements (Text, Spacing, Touch Targets)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, regardless of my screen size, I want text to be readable, UI elements to be well-spaced, and touch targets to be appropriately sized.

**Context:** This story focuses on fine-tuning the responsiveness of individual UI elements across the application, ensuring a consistent level of usability and visual appeal irrespective of the `WindowSizeClass`. It complements the broader layout adaptations (Story 7.2, 7.3) by addressing micro-level adjustments, as discussed in `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [204, 314].

## Detailed Requirements

* Review key Composables (`SearchBar` on `HomeScreen`, `ImageItem` in grid, `Text` elements and buttons in `ImageDetailScreen`/`ImageDetailPaneComposable`, `ErrorView`).
* Define typography and spacing guidelines that can adapt, or choose specific values, based on `WindowSizeClass` if significant changes are needed. For many cases, Material 3's default adaptive typography and spacing might be sufficient, but this story is to verify and tweak.
    * E.g., `MaterialTheme.typography.titleLarge` might be fine on all sizes, but padding around it could adapt.
* Consider using `LocalDensity.current.fontScale` to allow text to scale based on user's system font size settings, ensuring this doesn't break layouts.
* Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, clickable `ImageItem`s, icons in `TopAppBar`, "Retry" buttons) maintain a minimum touch target size of 48dp x 48dp across all configurations. This might involve adjusting `Modifier.size`, `Modifier.padding`, or using `Modifier.sizeIn(minWidth = 48.dp, minHeight = 48.dp)`.
* Test for readability (text size, contrast) and usability (element spacing, touch target accessibility) on `Compact`, `Medium`, and `Expanded` width classes.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Text in major UI elements (e.g., screen titles in `TopAppBar`, photographer names, descriptions, button text) remains legible and appropriately scaled across `Compact`, `Medium`, and `Expanded` width classes.
* AC2: Spacing (margins, paddings) around key UI elements (e.g., SearchBar, content areas, items in lists/grids) adapts gracefully to prevent clutter on small screens and excessive sparseness on large screens.
* AC3: All interactive elements consistently meet or exceed the minimum touch target size of 48dp x 48dp on all screen configurations.
* AC4: The overall visual hierarchy and balance of individual components are maintained across different screen sizes.
* AC5: App respects user's system font scaling settings without breaking critical layouts.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Stories 7.1-7.3 are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (SearchBar)
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ImageItem.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailScreen.kt` / `ImageDetailPaneComposable.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/ErrorView.kt`
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/Typography.kt` (if defining new adaptive styles or variants).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/theme/Dimens.kt` (if creating a dimens file for adaptive spacing, optional).
    * _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for adaptive design and accessibility. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [204, 314].)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `Modifier` (padding, size, sizeIn), `MaterialTheme.typography`, `LocalDensity.current.fontScale`.
    * `WindowSizeClass` (for conditional styling if needed, though often adaptive modifiers suffice).
    * Android Studio Layout Inspector & Compose Preview tools with different device configurations.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Prioritize using `MaterialTheme` for typography and relying on its inherent adaptability first.
    * Use `dp` for spacing and sizing. Text should use `sp`.
    * Ensure `Modifier.clickable` is applied to an area that meets touch target minimums, even if the visual graphic is smaller (use padding inside the clickable area).
    * Adhere to guidelines in `docs/coding-standards.md` (v1.1) section "Adaptive Design with WindowSizeClasses" and accessibility notes on touch targets.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Systematic UI Element Review:**
    * [ ] Go through each screen (`HomeScreen`, `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`, `ImageDetailScreen`/`Pane`, `ErrorView`) and significant reusable components (`ImageItem`, `SearchBar`).
    * [ ] For each screen/component, identify key text elements, interactive elements, and spacing patterns.
* [ ] **Typography Check & Adaptation:**
    * [ ] Verify all `Text` Composables use styles from `MaterialTheme.typography`.
    * [ ] Test with user system font scaling increased. If layouts break, consider if specific text elements need to cap their scaled size or if container layouts need more flexibility.
    * [ ] If `WindowSizeClass` specific typography variants are needed (e.g., slightly larger base font on Expanded), define them in `Typography.kt` and apply conditionally.
* [ ] **Spacing & Padding Review:**
    * [ ] Check margins around screen content, padding within cards/buttons, gaps between items.
    - [ ] Use values like `16.dp` as a base and see if they look appropriate across sizes. If needed, define different padding values based on `WindowSizeClass` (e.g., `val horizontalPadding = if (widthSizeClass == Compact) 16.dp else 24.dp`).
* [ ] **Touch Target Verification & Adjustment:**
    * [ ] For every `Button`, `IconButton`, `Modifier.clickable` usage:
        * Use Layout Inspector or visually estimate if the effective clickable area is >= 48dp x 48dp.
        * If not, increase padding within the clickable area or use `Modifier.sizeIn(minWidth = 48.dp, minHeight = 48.dp)` on the clickable element itself. For example, an `IconButton` often needs surrounding padding to meet this.
* [ ] **Test Across Configurations:**
    * [ ] Use Compose Previews with various device specs (`@Preview(device = Devices.PHONE)`, `@Preview(device = Devices.TABLET)`, `@Preview(uiMode = Configuration.UI_MODE_NIGHT_YES)` etc.).
    * [ ] Test on emulators for Compact, Medium, and Expanded width classes, in both orientations.
    * [ ] Specifically check readability, non-overlapping elements, and ease of interaction.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not primary for visual styling and sizing adjustments.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later, can be complex for precise size/spacing assertions)
    * Can assert semantic properties like `testTag` and then query for size, but visual inspection is key.
    * Tests can verify that `contentDescription` is present, aiding touch target identification for test scripts.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
    * AC1: Visually inspect text elements on various screen sizes (phone portrait/landscape, tablet portrait/landscape). Check for readability and appropriate scaling.
    * AC2: Visually inspect spacing. Ensure layouts don't feel cramped or too sparse.
    * AC3: Use Android Studio's Layout Inspector to check the bounds of clickable elements, or enable "Pointer location" in Developer Options on a device/emulator to measure touch areas. Verify they meet the 48dp minimum.
    * AC4: Assess overall visual balance and hierarchy on different screen sizes.
    * AC5: Change system font size in device settings. Relaunch app. Verify text scales and critical layouts do not break (e.g., text truncation, overlapping elements).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [204, 314]. Refer to Material Design guidelines for touch target sizes.)_
