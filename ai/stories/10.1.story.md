# Story 10.1: Refactor HomeScreen to Display Trending Photos and Update Search Access

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I open the app, I want the `HomeScreen` to primarily display a visually appealing grid of trending photos for immediate discovery, while still allowing me to easily access search functionality and my recent search history.

**Context:** This is the foundational story for Epic 10. It **refactors the existing `HomeScreen.kt`** to shift its primary focus from direct search input to displaying curated "trending" photos from the Pexels API (`/v1/curated`) using Jetpack Compose's `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`. The current direct search input field and recent searches display within `HomeScreen`'s main content area will be modified. Access to search functionality (which includes recent searches) will be streamlined, for example, through a search action icon in the `TopAppBar` that navigates to a dedicated search interface or expands a search UI. This aligns with PRD v1.2 Goal 7 ([157], [428]) and uses insights from `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

* **Modify `HomeScreen.kt`** in the `ui.home` package. It will remain the `startDestination` in the navigation graph.
  * The main content area will now predominantly display the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` of trending photos.
* Create `HomeScreenViewModel.kt` in `ui.home`, Hilt-injected. This new ViewModel will specifically manage the fetching, state, and pagination of trending photos from `ImageRepository` (Pexels API `/v1/curated`).
* `HomeScreenViewModel` to expose UI state for the trending photos (e.g., `StateFlow<HomeScreenUiState>` containing `isLoadingInitial: Boolean`, `photos: List<Photo>`, `errorMessage: String?`).
* The `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` will use the existing `ImageItem` Composable (from Story 3.2), loading an appropriate image size.
* **Refactor Search Functionality Access from `HomeScreen`:**
  * The `OutlinedTextField` currently in `HomeScreen.kt`'s main content for direct search input will be removed from this immediate layout.
  * The `LazyColumn` for displaying recent searches, currently part of `HomeScreen.kt`'s main content flow, will also be removed from this immediate layout.
  * A search action (e.g., an `IconButton` with a search icon) will be added to the `TopAppBar` of `HomeScreen.kt`.
  * Tapping this search action icon will navigate the user to the primary search interface (e.g., `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` or a similar screen that houses the `SearchViewModel`, search input field, and the display of recent searches).
  * The existing `SearchViewModel` (currently injected into `HomeScreen.kt`) will now be primarily associated with this dedicated search interface, not the trending photos display logic on `HomeScreen`. `HomeScreen` will now use the new `HomeScreenViewModel` for its trending photos content.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: `HomeScreen.kt` is **modified**; its primary content area now features the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` of trending photos. It remains the `startDestination`.
* AC2: A new `HomeScreenViewModel.kt` is created, Hilt-injected, and is responsible for fetching the first page of curated photos (trending photos) from `ImageRepository` upon its initialization.
* AC3: `HomeScreenViewModel` exposes `StateFlow<List<Photo>>` (for the trending photos) and `StateFlow<Boolean>` (for `isLoadingInitial` state of these trending photos).
* AC4: The modified `HomeScreen` observes states from `HomeScreenViewModel` to display the trending photos grid and its initial loading state.
* AC5: `HomeScreen` displays the fetched trending photos in a `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`, using the existing `ImageItem` Composable for each photo.
* AC6: Images in the trending grid are loaded via Coil, and the staggered layout correctly handles varying aspect ratios.
* AC7: A basic loading indicator is shown on `HomeScreen` if `HomeScreenViewModel.isLoadingInitial` is true and its `photos` list is empty.
* AC8: The `HomeScreen`'s `TopAppBar` now contains a search `IconButton`. Tapping this icon navigates the user to the designated screen/UI where search input and recent search history are handled (this screen will utilize the `SearchViewModel`). The direct search input field and recent searches list are no longer part of `HomeScreen`'s primary content area.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Epics 1-9 are complete. The existing `HomeScreen.kt` (which uses `SearchViewModel`) will be refactored.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create:
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreenViewModel.kt`
    * Potentially `HomeScreenUiState.kt` (data class/sealed interface for `HomeScreenViewModel`'s state).
  * Files to Modify:
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (Major refactoring: remove direct search UI, add trending grid, use new `HomeScreenViewModel`, add search icon to `TopAppBar`).
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (Ensure `HomeScreen` is `startDestination` and navigation from its new search icon to the search interface is correctly configured).
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/domain/repository/ImageRepository.kt` (ensure `getCuratedPhotos` method exists).
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/repository/ImageRepositoryImpl.kt` (implement `getCuratedPhotos`).
    * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/data/remote/PexelsApiService.kt` (ensure `/v1/curated` endpoint method exists).
    * The screen that will now handle search input (e.g., `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt` or a new `SearchInputScreen.kt`) will need to integrate the `SearchViewModel` and the recent searches UI.
  * _(Hint: `project-structure.md v1.2` will show `HomeScreenViewModel`. `architecture.md v1.2` updates `HomeScreen`'s role. PRD [35], [180], [451]. `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md` [Section 1].)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Jetpack Compose: `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`, `Scaffold`, `TopAppBar`, `IconButton`.
  * `androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.staggeredgrid.*`
  * Hilt (`@HiltViewModel` for `HomeScreenViewModel`).
  * ViewModel (`HomeScreenViewModel`, and existing `SearchViewModel` for the search flow).
  * `StateFlow`, Kotlin Coroutines (`viewModelScope`).
  * `ImageRepository`.
  * `PexelsApiService` (`/v1/curated`).
  * Coil.
  * `Photo` domain model.
  * Material Symbols (for search icon).
  * _(Hint: `tech-stack.md v1.2` lists `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `HomeScreenViewModel` calls `imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos(page: Int, perPage: Int)`.
  * This eventually calls `GET /v1/curated` on Pexels API.
  * _(Hint: `api-reference.md` details the `/v1/curated` endpoint.)_

* **Data Structures:**
  * `HomeScreenViewModel` state: `StateFlow<List<Photo>>` for trending photos, `StateFlow<Boolean>` for initial loading of trending photos.
  * `Photo` domain model.
  * _(Hint: `data-models.md v1.1` for `Photo`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
  * `PEXELS_API_KEY` (used by `PexelsApiService`).
  * _(Hint: See `environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * `HomeScreenViewModel` is responsible for trending photos logic.
  * `SearchViewModel` remains responsible for search query, search execution, and search history logic, but its UI will be hosted on a different screen/flow initiated from `HomeScreen`.
  * `HomeScreen.kt` orchestrates the display of trending photos and provides a navigation point to the search experience.
  * Refer to `coding-standards.md v1.2` for `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` best practices.
  * _(Hint: See `coding-standards.md v1.2` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Ensure Pexels API access for Curated Photos is ready:**
  * [ ] Verify `PexelsApiService.kt` has a method for `GET /v1/curated` returning `Response<PexelsSearchResponseDto>`.
  * [ ] Verify `ImageRepository.kt` (Interface) and `ImageRepositoryImpl.kt` have a corresponding `suspend fun getCuratedPhotos(page: Int, perPage: Int): ResultWrapper<PexelsSearchResponseDto>` method.
* [ ] **Create `HomeScreenViewModel.kt`:**
  * [ ] Annotate with `@HiltViewModel`, inject `ImageRepository`.
  * [ ] Define state flows: `_photos` (for `List<Photo>`), `photos`, `_isLoadingInitial` (Boolean), `isLoadingInitial`, and `_errorState` (for Story 10.6).
  * [ ] Define `ITEMS_PER_PAGE` constant.
  * [ ] Implement `private fun fetchInitialPhotos()`: sets `_isLoadingInitial` true, calls repository's `getCuratedPhotos(page = 1)`, updates `_photos` on success, sets `_errorState` on error, sets `_isLoadingInitial` false in `finally`.
  * [ ] Call `WorkspaceInitialPhotos()` in an `init {}` block.
* [ ] **Refactor `HomeScreen.kt`:**
  * [ ] Change injected ViewModel from `SearchViewModel` to `viewModel: HomeScreenViewModel = hiltViewModel()`. (It will still need `navController` and `windowSizeClass`).
  * [ ] Collect `photosList by viewModel.photos.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
  * [ ] Collect `isLoading by viewModel.isLoadingInitial.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
  * [ ] Update the `Scaffold`:
    * `TopAppBar`: Set title (e.g., "PexelsSample" or "Trending"). Add an `actions` slot. Inside `actions`, add an `IconButton` with a search icon.
      * `onClick` for this search icon should use `navController.navigate(ScreenRoutes.ADAPTIVE_SEARCH_RESULTS_HOST)` (or the designated route that now hosts the `SearchViewModel`-driven search UI, including the original search bar and recent searches list).
  * [ ] **Main Content Area (`Column` inside `Scaffold`):**
    * **Remove** the existing `OutlinedTextField` for search.
    * **Remove** the existing `LazyColumn` for recent searches.
    * If `isLoading && photosList.isEmpty()`, display a centered `CircularProgressIndicator()`.
    * Else if `photosList.isNotEmpty()`, display the `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`:
      * `columns = StaggeredGridCells.Fixed(2)` (column count logic will be refined in Story 10.3).
      * `modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()`.
      * Add `contentPadding`, `verticalItemSpacing`, `horizontalArrangement` (details in Story 10.5).
      * `items(photosList, key = { photo -> photo.id }) { photo -> ImageItem(photo = photo, onItemClick = { /* Navigation to detail: Story 10.7 */ }) }`.
    * (Full error/empty state handling will be refined in Story 10.6).
* [ ] **Update `AppNavigation.kt`:**
  * [ ] Confirm `HomeScreen` (now showing trending photos) is the `startDestination`.
  * [ ] Ensure the route used by the new search icon in `HomeScreen`'s `TopAppBar` (e.g., `ScreenRoutes.ADAPTIVE_SEARCH_RESULTS_HOST`) correctly leads to a screen that is set up to use `SearchViewModel` and can display the search input field and recent search history. This might involve refactoring where `SearchViewModel` is instantiated/scoped if it was previously only on `HomeScreen`.
* [ ] **Adapt the Search UI Flow:**
  * The screen that the search icon navigates to (e.g., `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt` or a new `SearchInputScreen.kt`) must now be responsible for:
    * Hosting the `SearchViewModel`.
    * Displaying the `OutlinedTextField` for search queries.
    * Displaying the recent search history list when the search field is focused and empty.
  * This might involve moving UI elements and `SearchViewModel` logic previously in `HomeScreen.kt` (as per your provided file) to this new/refactored search screen.
* [ ] Test the refactored `HomeScreen` for initial load and display of trending photos.
* [ ] Test that the new search icon navigates to the correct screen where search input and history are now handled.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
  * `HomeScreenViewModel`: Mock `ImageRepository`. Test initial trending photos fetch: verify `isLoadingInitial` state, `photos` state updates on success, error state on failure.
  * `ImageRepositoryImpl`: Test `getCuratedPhotos` method logic (mock `PexelsApiService`).
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
  * (To be formalized later) Test `HomeScreen` displays `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` with items when `HomeScreenViewModel` provides data. Test initial loading indicator visibility. Test that the search icon in `TopAppBar` correctly navigates to the designated search interface screen.
  * _(Refer to `testing-strategy.md v1.2` for HomeScreen UI test considerations.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  * AC1: Run app. Verify `HomeScreen` is the first screen and its main content is now the grid of trending photos (or a loading indicator for them).
  * AC2: Verify (via logs/debugger) `HomeScreenViewModel` is created and calls `imageRepository.getCuratedPhotos`.
  * AC3, AC4: Confirm `HomeScreenViewModel` exposes `photos` and `isLoadingInitial` states, and `HomeScreen` observes them for the trending grid.
  * AC7: While trending photos are loading, verify a loading indicator is shown.
  * AC5, AC6: After loading, verify trending photos are displayed in a `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`. Check images of different aspect ratios are rendered correctly by Coil within `ImageItem`.
  * AC8: Verify the `TopAppBar` on `HomeScreen` contains a search icon. Click it. Confirm navigation to the screen that now handles search input and recent history (this screen should use `SearchViewModel`). The old direct search input and recent searches should no longer be visible in `HomeScreen`'s main content area.
* _(Hint: See `testing-strategy.md v1.2` and `research-homescreen-trending-photos.md`.)_
