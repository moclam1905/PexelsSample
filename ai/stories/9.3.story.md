# Story 9.3: Animate Appearance of Empty/Error/Loading States

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when the app transitions to an empty state (no search results), an error state, or a full-screen loading state, I want these state indicators to appear with a subtle animation, making the transition less jarring.

**Context:** This story applies animations to the appearance and disappearance of full-screen state indicators like the initial loading spinner (from Story 2.4 / 5.5), the `ErrorView` (Story 5.1), and the "No Results" message (Story 3.5). This aims to make state transitions smoother and more polished, as per PRD v1.1 [322] and research [270].

## Detailed Requirements

* Wrap the top-level Composables responsible for displaying these full-screen/central states within `AnimatedVisibility`.
    * Applicable states/Composables:
        * Centered `CircularProgressIndicator` for initial search loading (on `SearchResultsScreen` or `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`).
        * `ErrorView` Composable when a global error is shown (on `SearchResultsScreen` or `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`).
        * "No Results Found" message Composable (on `SearchResultsScreen` or `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`).
* Apply a standard entrance animation (e.g., `fadeIn(animationSpec = tween(300)) + slideInVertically(initialOffsetY = { it / 10 })`) and a corresponding exit animation (e.g., `fadeOut(animationSpec = tween(300)) + slideOutVertically(targetOffsetY = { it / 10 })`).
* Ensure these animations are consistent for similar types of state transitions.
* The animations should not delay the user from seeing critical information in error states.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The full-screen/central loading indicator (for initial search) animates in and out smoothly (e.g., fades and slides slightly) when its visibility changes.
* AC2: The `ErrorView` Composable animates in and out smoothly when its visibility changes.
* AC3: The "No Results Found" message Composable animates in and out smoothly when its visibility changes.
* AC4: The animations are brief (e.g., ~300ms), use appropriate easing (e.g., `tween`), and feel polished rather than distracting.
* AC5: The appearance/disappearance of these animated states correctly corresponds to the underlying ViewModel state changes (e.g., `isLoading`, `errorState`, `isResultsEmpty`).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Previous state handling stories (2.4, 3.5, 5.1, 5.5) are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt` (or `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt` where these states are conditionally rendered).
        * Potentially `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/common/LoadingIndicator.kt` or `ErrorView.kt` if the animation is applied *inside* them rather than around them, but wrapping the instance is usually cleaner.
    * _(Hint: `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [270] for state appearance animations. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for UI Animations.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose: `AnimatedVisibility`, `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `slideInVertically`, `slideOutVertically`, `tween`.
    * ViewModel states (`isLoading`, `errorState`, `isResultsEmpty`).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1 for Compose animation APIs.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * ViewModel states that control visibility of these UI elements.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Keep animations subtle and consistent.
    * Ensure `AnimatedVisibility` correctly wraps the Composable whose appearance/disappearance is being animated.
    * Test that content correctly recomposes when visibility state changes.
    * Adhere to "UI Animations and Transitions" in `docs/coding-standards.md` (v1.1).
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] In `SearchResultsScreen.kt` (or `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt`):
    * [ ] Locate the conditional rendering logic for the initial loading indicator (e.g., centered `CircularProgressIndicator`). Wrap it with `AnimatedVisibility`:
      ```kotlin
      // AnimatedVisibility(
      //     visible = isLoadingInitial && photos.isEmpty() && !error, // Your condition
      //     enter = fadeIn(tween(300)) + slideInVertically(initialOffsetY = { fullHeight -> fullHeight / 10 }),
      //     exit = fadeOut(tween(300)) + slideOutVertically(targetOffsetY = { fullHeight -> fullHeight / 10 })
      // ) {
      //     CenteredCircularProgressIndicator()
      // }
      ```
    * [ ] Locate the conditional rendering for `ErrorView`. Wrap it similarly with `AnimatedVisibility`, using the same or consistent enter/exit transitions.
    * [ ] Locate the conditional rendering for the "No Results Found" message. Wrap it similarly with `AnimatedVisibility`.
* [ ] Define common animation specs if desired:
    ```kotlin
    // val enterTransition = fadeIn(tween(300)) + slideInVertically(initialOffsetY = { it / 10 })
    // val exitTransition = fadeOut(tween(300)) + slideOutVertically(targetOffsetY = { it / 10 })
    ```
    And reuse these in `AnimatedVisibility`.
* [ ] Test each state transition to ensure animations play correctly and states don't overlap visually during transitions.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Not primary for visual animation.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (Challenging for verifying "smoothness" but can verify visibility changes)
    * Test that when ViewModel state changes to `isLoading=true`, the loading indicator becomes visible (potentially with a slight delay due to animation that might need to be handled in test).
    * Similar tests for `ErrorView` and "No Results" message visibility based on ViewModel state.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification (Primary method):**
    * AC1: Trigger initial search loading. Verify the loading indicator animates in (e.g., fades/slides in). Verify it animates out when loading finishes.
    * AC2: Trigger an error state. Verify `ErrorView` animates in. Resolve error or navigate away; verify it animates out.
    * AC3: Search for a term with no results. Verify "No Results" message animates in. Perform a new search with results; verify message animates out.
    * AC4: Observe animation durations and easing. They should feel brief and natural.
    * AC5: Confirm that the correct state UI is shown based on ViewModel, and transitions are clean.
