# Story 5.3: Handle Pexels API Specific Errors

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, if the Pexels API returns an error (e.g., rate limit exceeded, invalid API key, server issue), I want to be informed appropriately.

**Context:** This story builds on generic (Story 5.1) and network error handling (Story 5.2). It focuses on interpreting HTTP error codes from Pexels API responses (when `response.isSuccessful` is false) and providing specific user-facing messages.

## Detailed Requirements

* Enhance the networking error handling in `SearchViewModel` (for calls made via `PexelsApiService`) to parse and identify specific HTTP error codes from Pexels API (e.g., 401/403 for auth issues - though 401 should ideally not happen with a correct key, 403 might; 404 for not found if a specific resource were requested; 429 for rate limits; 5xx for server errors).
* `SearchViewModel` should update its `errorState` to reflect these specific API errors with tailored messages.
* Display user-friendly messages via `ErrorView`:
    * For rate limits (429): "Too many requests. Please try again later." (Retry might be disabled or have a delay, i.e., `isRetryable = false` or handle retry with delay).
    * For auth issues (401/403): "Authentication failed. Please contact support." (`isRetryable = false`). (Actual message may vary based on app's support model).
    * For general Pexels server errors (5xx): "Pexels.com seems to be having issues. Please try again later." (`isRetryable = true`).
    * For other client errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request from API if query params are wrong, though app should prevent this): "Invalid request. Please try again." (`isRetryable = true`).
* Offer "Retry" option via `ErrorView` where appropriate.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: `SearchViewModel`'s API call handling logic (when `response.isSuccessful` is false) checks `response.code()`.
-   AC2: Specific `UserFacingError` messages are set in `errorState` based on HTTP codes:
    -   `401/403`: Auth error message, `isRetryable = false`.
    -   `429`: Rate limit message, `isRetryable = false` (or true with delayed retry logic not in scope for this story).
    -   `5xx`: Server error message, `isRetryable = true`.
    -   Other `4xx`: Generic client error message, `isRetryable = true`.
-   AC3: `ErrorView` displays these specific messages correctly.
-   AC4: The "Retry" button in `ErrorView` is shown/hidden based on `error.isRetryable` and functions as expected.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes Story 5.1 & 5.2 are complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
    -   _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` for error handling.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   Retrofit `Response.code()`, `Response.message()`, `Response.errorBody()`.
    -   Kotlin `when` expression for handling different codes.
    -   `SearchViewModel` state management.
    -   `UserFacingError` and `ErrorView`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Interprets error responses from Pexels API calls.
    -   Pexels API specific error codes mentioned in `docs/api-reference.md` (e.g., 429).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for Pexels API details, and search results for common Pexels API error codes.)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `UserFacingError` data class.
    -   _(Hint: `docs/coding-standards.md` section on "Error Handling Strategy")_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   Make error messages clear and distinct.
    -   Logic for determining `isRetryable` should be sound based on error type.
    -   Default/fallback error message for unhandled HTTP error codes.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    -   [ ] In the API call handling logic (e.g., in `onSearchClicked` and `loadNextPage`), specifically where `response.isSuccessful` is `false`:
        -   Use a `when(response.code())` statement:
            -   `401, 403 -> _errorState.value = UserFacingError("Authentication error. Please check configuration.", isRetryable = false)`
            -   `429 -> _errorState.value = UserFacingError("Too many requests. Please try again in an hour.", isRetryable = false)`
            -   `in 500..599 -> _errorState.value = UserFacingError("Pexels.com seems to be unavailable. Please try again later.", isRetryable = true)`
            -   `in 400..499 -> _errorState.value = UserFacingError("Invalid request (Error ${response.code()}). Please try modifying your search.", isRetryable = true)` // Generic for other 4xx
            -   `else -> _errorState.value = UserFacingError("An unknown error occurred (Error ${response.code()}). Please try again.", isRetryable = true)`
    -   [ ] Ensure the general `catch (e: Exception)` block (if not an `IOException` already handled by Story 5.2) sets a generic error like:
        `_errorState.value = UserFacingError("An unexpected error occurred: ${e.localizedMessage ?: "Unknown"}", isRetryable = true)`
    -   [ ] Ensure `_isLoading.value` / `_isLoadingMore.value` are set to `false` when these errors occur.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   Mock `PexelsApiService` and `Response<T>` object.
    -   For each relevant HTTP error code (401, 403, 429, 500, generic 4xx), configure the mock `Response` to return that code.
    -   Verify `SearchViewModel.errorState` is updated with the correct `UserFacingError` (message and `isRetryable` flag).
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Using `OkHttp MockWebServer` (as per `docs/testing-strategy.md`), configure it to return specific HTTP error codes for API requests.
    -   Verify that `SearchViewModel` reacts correctly by setting the appropriate `errorState`.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   This is harder to reliably trigger specific Pexels API errors manually, but:
    -   AC1, AC2, AC3: Review code. If possible, to test 429, one might rapidly make requests (not recommended against live API). To test auth error, temporarily use an invalid API key (ensure to revert). Server errors (5xx) depend on Pexels' availability.
    -   AC4: If an error occurs for which `isRetryable` is true, verify "Retry" button works. If `isRetryable` is false, verify button is hidden or disabled.
    -   Focus on unit and MockWebServer tests for thorough verification of different error codes.
