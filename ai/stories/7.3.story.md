# Story 7.3: Implement Adaptive Layout for Image Detail View (Optional Two-Pane)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user with a larger screen (e.g., a tablet in landscape), I want to potentially see the image detail view alongside the search results list, so I can browse and view details more efficiently without full screen navigation for each image.

**Context:** This story implements a more significant adaptive change: a master-detail (two-pane) layout for wider screens, as suggested in PRD v1.1 [315] and `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [203]. It leverages `WindowSizeClass` (Story 7.1) and affects how users navigate to and interact with image details on `Expanded` width screens.

## Detailed Requirements

* Create a new top-level Composable, potentially named `MainContentScreen.kt` or similar, that will host both search results and image details, and make decisions based on `WindowSizeClass`. Alternatively, adapt `HomeScreen.kt` or `SearchResultsScreen.kt` to manage this. *Decision: Create a new Composable, e.g., `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt`, which will be navigated to for showing results. This host will then decide whether to show list-only or list-detail.*
* This host screen will consume `WindowSizeClass`.
* If `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Expanded`:
    * Display `SearchResultsListComposable` (a refactored part of original `SearchResultsScreen` showing just the grid) in one pane (e.g., 1/3 width).
    * Display `ImageDetailPaneComposable` (a refactored part of `ImageDetailScreen` or a new Composable tailored for a pane) in another pane (e.g., 2/3 width). Use `Row` with `Modifier.weight()` for panes.
    * `SearchViewModel` needs to be enhanced or a shared ViewModel strategy employed:
        * It should hold the state of the currently selected `Photo` (e.g., `selectedPhotoForDetail: StateFlow<Photo?>`).
        * Tapping an item in `SearchResultsListComposable` updates `selectedPhotoForDetail` in the ViewModel.
        * `ImageDetailPaneComposable` observes `selectedPhotoForDetail` and displays its content. No full navigation occurs.
* If `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Compact` or `Medium`:
    * The host screen shows only `SearchResultsListComposable` (full width).
    * Tapping an item uses the existing full-screen Jetpack Navigation to the standard `ImageDetailScreen` (passing `photoId`).
* Pinch-to-zoom (Epic 6) must function correctly within the `ImageDetailPaneComposable`.
* State of selected item in list and zoom state in detail pane must be handled robustly across configuration changes.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Expanded`, a new host screen (`AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`) displays a two-pane layout: search results list in one pane, image detail in the other.
* AC2: In two-pane mode, selecting an image in the list pane updates the content of the detail pane without a full screen navigation. The detail pane shows details for the selected photo.
* AC3: When `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` is `Compact` or `Medium`, the host screen shows only the search results list. Tapping an image navigates to the existing full-screen `ImageDetailScreen`.
* AC4: Pinch-to-zoom functionality (from Epic 6) works correctly within the detail pane of the two-pane layout.
* AC5: Navigation logic (back stack, up navigation) is consistent and intuitive for both single-pane (navigation) and two-pane (selection) modes. When in two-pane view, back press might deselect item or navigate away from host screen.
* AC6: State of selected item and zoom state (if applicable) in the detail pane are preserved across configuration changes.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Stories 7.1, 7.2, and Epic 6 are complete.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Create:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/adaptive/AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt` (new host screen).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsListComposable.kt` (refactored from `SearchResultsScreen`).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailPaneComposable.kt` (refactored/adapted from `ImageDetailScreen`).
    * Files to Modify:
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/core/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (to navigate to `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt` (to manage `selectedPhotoForDetail` state).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/detail/ImageDetailViewModel.kt` (if used for zoom state, needs to work with `Photo` object passed to pane).
        * `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` (to navigate to `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` instead of old `SearchResultsScreen`).
    * _(Hint: `docs/architecture.md` v1.1 component view shows `AdaptiveLayoutHost`. `docs/deep-research-bonus-features.md` [203] for two-pane.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Jetpack Compose (`Row`, `Modifier.weight`, conditional Composable display).
    * `WindowSizeClass`.
    * `SearchViewModel` (shared or accessible, to hold `selectedPhotoForDetail` and list).
    * `ImageDetailViewModel` (for zoom state in pane, needs to be instantiated appropriately for the detail pane).
    * Jetpack Navigation Compose (for fallback to full-screen detail).
    * _(Hint: `docs/tech-stack.md` v1.1. `docs/coding-standards.md` v1.1 for adaptive design.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * Not directly, relies on already fetched data.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

* **Data Structures:**
    * `selectedPhotoForDetail: StateFlow<Photo?>` in `SearchViewModel`.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Environment Variables:**
    * Not applicable.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Clearly define responsibilities for `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`, `SearchResultsListComposable`, and `ImageDetailPaneComposable`.
    * ViewModel strategy: `SearchViewModel` could be scoped to the navigation graph that includes `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`. `ImageDetailViewModel` might be created with `photoId` or `Photo` object when the detail pane becomes active.
    * Back navigation in two-pane mode: define if it deselects the item (clears detail pane) or navigates up from the host screen.
    * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Refactor existing screens:**
    * [ ] Extract the `LazyVerticalGrid` and its surrounding logic from `SearchResultsScreen.kt` into a new `SearchResultsListComposable(windowSizeClass, photos, onPhotoClick, onScrollNearEnd)` Composable. `onPhotoClick` will take a `Photo`.
    * [ ] Adapt `ImageDetailScreen.kt`'s content (image display, metadata, zoom logic) into a reusable `ImageDetailPaneComposable(photo: Photo?, windowSizeClass)` that can be used in a pane or full screen. (It will internally use/manage `ImageDetailViewModel` for zoom state).
* [ ] **Update `SearchViewModel.kt`:**
    * [ ] Add `private val _selectedPhotoForDetail = MutableStateFlow<Photo?>(null)`.
    * [ ] Add `val selectedPhotoForDetail: StateFlow<Photo?> = _selectedPhotoForDetail.asStateFlow()`.
    * [ ] Add `fun onPhotoSelected(photo: Photo) { _selectedPhotoForDetail.value = photo }`.
    * [ ] Add `fun clearDetailSelection() { _selectedPhotoForDetail.value = null }`.
* [ ] **Create `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen.kt`:**
    * [ ] Accept `navController: NavController`, `windowSizeClass: WindowSizeClass`.
    * [ ] Inject/obtain `SearchViewModel`.
    * [ ] Based on `windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass`:
        * **Expanded:**
            * Use `Row`. `SearchResultsListComposable` in one weighted pane. `ImageDetailPaneComposable` in other.
            * `onPhotoClick` from list calls `searchViewModel.onPhotoSelected(it)`.
            * `ImageDetailPaneComposable` observes `searchViewModel.selectedPhotoForDetail`.
        * **Compact/Medium:**
            * Display only `SearchResultsListComposable` (full width).
            * `onPhotoClick` from list calls `navController.navigate("imageDetail/${it.id}")` (to existing full `ImageDetailScreen`).
* [ ] **Update `AppNavigation.kt`:**
    * [ ] Change route from `HomeScreen` to navigate to `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen` when search is initiated (passing `windowSizeClass`).
    * [ ] Ensure the full `ImageDetailScreen` route still exists for Compact/Medium navigation.
* [ ] **Handle Back Press in `AdaptiveSearchResultsHostScreen`:**
    * If two-pane and an item is selected (`_selectedPhotoForDetail.value != null`), back press should call `searchViewModel.clearDetailSelection()`.
    * If no item selected or not two-pane, standard `navController.popBackStack()`. (This needs careful handling with `BackHandler` Composable).
* [ ] **State Preservation:**
    * `SearchViewModel` already handles search query/results list persistence (from MVP/Epic 2).
    * `selectedPhotoForDetail` ID might need to be saved in `SearchViewModel`'s `SavedStateHandle` if it needs to survive process death in two-pane mode.
    * Zoom state in `ImageDetailPaneComposable` is handled by `ImageDetailViewModel` (Story 6.5).
* [ ] Test thoroughly on phone (portrait/landscape) and tablet (portrait/landscape) emulators.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests:**
    * `SearchViewModel`: Test `onPhotoSelected` and `clearDetailSelection` correctly update `selectedPhotoForDetail` state. Test saving/restoring selected photo ID via `SavedStateHandle`.
* **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    * (To be formalized later) Test on different `WindowSizeClass` configurations:
        * Expanded: Verify two panes appear. Click item in list, verify detail pane updates. Verify pinch-zoom works in detail pane.
        * Compact/Medium: Verify list appears full width. Click item, verify navigation to full `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * Test back navigation behavior in both modes.
    * Test state restoration for selected item and zoom after configuration change.
    * _(Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` v1.1 for UI test considerations for adaptive layouts.)_
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    * AC1, AC2: Run on tablet emulator in landscape (`Expanded` width). Perform search. Verify two panes. Click list items; verify detail pane updates.
    * AC3: Run on phone emulator (`Compact`/`Medium` width). Perform search. Click list item; verify navigation to full `ImageDetailScreen`.
    * AC4: In two-pane mode on tablet, verify pinch-to-zoom works in the detail pane.
    * AC5: Test back button:
        * In two-pane with item selected: back deselects item (clears detail pane).
        * In two-pane with no item selected: back navigates from host screen.
        * In single-pane (navigated from list): back navigates from full detail to list.
    * AC6: Perform selection in two-pane, rotate. Verify selection and zoom state are restored.
