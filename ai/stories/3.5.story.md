# Story 3.5: Handle Empty Search Results State

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, if my search query yields no results, I want to see a clear message indicating this, so that I understand why no images are displayed.

**Context:** This story addresses a common scenario in search functionality: no results found. It ensures the user isn't left with a blank screen but is informed appropriately. This builds upon the result display structure (Story 3.1) and ViewModel logic (Story 3.3).

## Detailed Requirements

* The `SearchViewModel` should expose a state indicating whether the last search yielded zero results (e.g., `isResultsEmpty: StateFlow<Boolean>`). This should be true if an API call was successful (`!isLoading`, no error) BUT the list of `photos` is empty AND a search has been attempted.
* The `SearchResultsScreen` (or relevant UI part, like `HomeScreen` if it displays results) should observe this state.
* If `isResultsEmpty` is true (and not in an initial loading state for the query):
    * Hide the results list/grid (if it was being shown or was about to be shown).
    * Display a user-friendly message (e.g., "No images found for '[search query]'. Try a different search."). The message should ideally include the search query.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: `SearchViewModel` exposes `isResultsEmpty: StateFlow<Boolean>` (default `false`). This becomes `true` only if a search was performed, loading finished, no error occurred, and the resulting `photos` list is empty. It should be `false` if a search hasn't been performed yet or if there are results.
-   AC2: On `SearchResultsScreen`, when `isResultsEmpty` is true (and not `isLoading`), the `LazyVerticalGrid` is not shown (or shows its own empty state if that's how it's configured by Compose).
-   AC3: A clear, user-friendly message (e.g., "No images found for '[query]'. Try another search.") is displayed on `SearchResultsScreen` when `isResultsEmpty` is true. The actual search query should be part of the message.
-   AC4: The "no results" message is not shown during initial loading, if there are results, or before a search is performed.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Assumes previous stories in Epic 3 are complete.

-   **Relevant Files:**
    -   Files to Modify:
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/home/SearchViewModel.kt`
        -   `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/pexelssample/ui/results/SearchResultsScreen.kt`
    -   _(Hint: `docs/project-structure.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md`.)_

-   **Key Technologies:**
    -   ViewModel, `StateFlow`, `MutableStateFlow`.
    -   Jetpack Compose (conditional UI rendering, `Text`).
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`.)_

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    -   Relies on API call completion (success with empty data) from `SearchViewModel`.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `_isResultsEmpty = MutableStateFlow(false)` in `SearchViewModel`.
    -   Need to also consider if a search has been "attempted" to distinguish initial state from empty result state. A simple flag `private var searchAttempted = false` could work, or infer from other states.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`.)_

-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   Not applicable.
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**
    -   The "empty" state should only show after a search attempt.
    -   The message should be helpful to the user.
    -   Ensure distinction between "initial empty screen before any search", "loading", "error", and "empty results after search".
    -   _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] Modify `SearchViewModel.kt`:
    -   [ ] Add `private val _isResultsEmpty = MutableStateFlow(false)`.
    -   [ ] Add `val isResultsEmpty: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isResultsEmpty.asStateFlow()`.
    -   [ ] Add `private var searchAttempted = false` (or a similar mechanism).
    -   [ ] In `onSearchClicked()`:
        -   Set `searchAttempted = true` when a search is initiated.
        -   Reset `_isResultsEmpty.value = false` at the start of a new search.
        -   In the API success block:
            -   If `mappedResults.isEmpty()` (after mapping DTOs) AND `!_isLoading.value` (i.e., loading finished):
                -   Set `_isResultsEmpty.value = true`.
            -   Else:
                -   Set `_isResultsEmpty.value = false`.
    -   [ ] Ensure `_isResultsEmpty.value` is also reset to `false` if an error occurs during search (error state takes precedence).
-   [ ] Modify `SearchResultsScreen.kt`:
    -   [ ] Collect `isResultsEmpty`, `isLoading` (initial load), and `searchQuery` (from `SearchViewModel.searchQuery` for the message) states.
    -   [ ] Implement conditional UI logic:
        ```kotlin
        // val photosList by viewModel.photos.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
        // val isLoadingInitial by viewModel.isLoading.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
        // val isEmptyResults by viewModel.isResultsEmpty.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
        // val currentQuery by viewModel.searchQuery.collectAsStateWithLifecycle() // Assuming searchQuery is exposed

        // if (isLoadingInitial) {
        //     // Show main loading indicator (already done in Story 2.4, ensure it's visible here too if this screen handles initial load)
        // } else if (isEmptyResults) {
        //     // Display "No images found for '[currentQuery]'. Try another search." Text
        // } else if (photosList.isNotEmpty()) {
        //     // Display LazyVerticalGrid (from Story 3.1, 3.4)
        // } else {
        //     // Optional: Show something if no search has been performed yet and list is empty,
        //     // or if it's the initial state of SearchResultsScreen before VM populates.
        //     // Could be an empty Box or a prompt to search from HomeScreen.
        //     // For now, assume if not loading and not empty results, and list is empty, it implies initial state or error handled elsewhere.
        // }
        ```
    -   [ ] Ensure the `LazyVerticalGrid` and its pagination loading indicator are only shown if `!isEmptyResults` and `photosList.isNotEmpty()`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
-   **Unit Tests (for `SearchViewModel.kt`):**
    -   Mock `PexelsApiService`.
    -   Test scenario: API call successful, returns empty list of photos. Verify `isResultsEmpty` becomes `true`, `photos` list is empty.
    -   Test scenario: API call successful, returns non-empty list. Verify `isResultsEmpty` is `false`.
    -   Test scenario: Before any search, `isResultsEmpty` is `false`.
    -   Test scenario: API call fails. Verify `isResultsEmpty` is `false` (error state should be shown instead).
-   **Integration Tests (UI Tests using Jetpack Compose UI Test):**
    -   (To be written later) Mock ViewModel to emit `isResultsEmpty = true`. Verify UI shows the "no results" message and hides the grid. Mock ViewModel to emit results; verify grid shows.
-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    -   AC1: Review `SearchViewModel.kt` logic for `isResultsEmpty`.
    -   Run app.
    -   AC3, AC4:
        -   Perform a search with a query known to yield no results (e.g., "asdfqwertzxcv").
        -   After loading finishes, verify the `SearchResultsScreen` displays the "No images found for 'asdfqwertzxcv'..." message.
        -   Verify the image grid is not visible.
        -   Perform a new search that yields results (e.g., "cats"). Verify the "no results" message disappears and the grid with images is shown.
    -   AC2: Confirm the grid is hidden when the "no results" message is shown.
    -   Verify the "no results" message is not shown during the initial loading spinner.
-   _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for detailed testing approaches.)_
