# **Project Brief: PexelsSample**

## **Introduction / Problem Statement**

The project is to develop "PexelsSample," an Android application that allows users to seamlessly search for and browse high-quality images using the Pexels API. Currently, users wanting to access Pexels images on an Android device might rely on the website or third-party apps with varying user experiences. This project aims to provide a dedicated, well-designed, and performant native Android application for this purpose, showcasing best practices in Android development.

## **Vision & Goals**

* **Vision:** To create a clean, modern, and intuitive Android application that offers users an excellent experience for discovering, viewing, and interacting with the vast library of images available through the Pexels API.  
* **Primary Goals (MVP):**  
  * Goal 1: Users can successfully search for images using keywords via the Pexels Search API.  
  * Goal 2: Search results are displayed in a visually appealing and responsive layout, with pagination to load more results smoothly.  
  * Goal 3: Users can tap on an image in the results to view it in a detailed, full-screen or larger view.  
  * Goal 4: The application gracefully handles and communicates loading states, error conditions (e.g., network issues, API errors), and empty states (e.g., no search results).  
  * Goal 5: The application is built using Kotlin, adheres to Android best practices, features a modern and scalable architecture, maintains clean and readable code with proper separation of concerns, and demonstrates production-quality feature development.  
* **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**  
  * Number of successful image searches performed.  
  * Average number of images viewed per user session.  
  * Task completion rate for core flows (search \-\> view results \-\> view image detail).  
  * App stability (low crash rate).  
  * Positive user feedback on UI/UX (if user testing is conducted).

## **Target Audience / Users**

The primary users are individuals who need to find and browse high-quality stock images. This could include designers, content creators, marketers, bloggers, or anyone looking for visually appealing images for personal or professional use on their Android devices. They appreciate a clean, modern interface and a smooth, efficient user experience.

## **Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)**

* **Image Search:** Allow users to input search terms to find images using the Pexels API.  
* **Results Display:** Present search results in a visually appealing grid or list layout.  
* **Pagination:** Implement infinite scrolling or a "load more" mechanism for Browse through extensive search results.  
* **Image Detail View:** Allow users to tap an image to see a larger version.  
* **State Handling:** Implement UI for loading, error (e.g., network error, API error), and empty result states.

### **Bonus Features (Nice to Have / Post-MVP):**

* Pinch-to-zoom functionality in the image detail view.  
* Responsive/Adaptive layouts to better support different screen sizes and orientations.  
* Pull-to-refresh functionality on the results screen.  
* Support for search history or displaying recent searches.  
* UI Animations to enhance user experience.

### **New Features:**

* HomeScreen \- Trending Photos Integration 

  * ### Displaying Image Grids with Variable Item Heights (Staggered Grid Layouts) using Jetpack Compose

  * ###  Dynamic Column Count (Portrait vs. Landscape)

  * ### User-Initiated "Refresh" Button 

## **Known Technical Constraints or Preferences**

* **Constraints:**  
  * Must use the Pexels API for image data.  
  * Requires a Pexels API key (developer to sign up and manage securely).  
  * Must adhere to Pexels API usage terms.  
* **Technical Mandates & Preferences:**  
  * The app must be built using **Kotlin**.  
  * It must follow **Android best practices** and a **modern, scalable architecture** (e.g., MVVM, MVI).  
  * The code must be **clean, easy to read, and maintainable**.  
  * **Proper separation of concerns** must be observed (e.g., UI, business logic, data layers).  
  * The solution must demonstrate the ability to build **production-quality features**.  
  * UI design is flexible but should prioritize a **clean, modern aesthetic**.  
* **Risks:**  
  * Potential Pexels API rate limits or downtime affecting app functionality.  
  * Ensuring a highly performant and visually appealing image loading and display mechanism, especially with pagination.  
  * Managing API key security effectively within the application.  
  * Scope creep if bonus features are not clearly delineated from MVP.

## **Relevant Research (Optional)**

* Pexels API Documentation: [https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/\#introduction](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#introduction)  
* Detailed Research for Bonus Features (Post-MVP): Comprehensive findings covering implementation strategies, best practices, UI/UX considerations, and potential challenges for Pinch-to-Zoom, Responsive/Adaptive Layouts, Pull-to-Refresh, Search History, and UI Animations have been compiled. \*This research is available in a separate supporting document to ensure the main brief remains concise.

## **PM Agent Handoff Prompt**

### **Summary of Key Insights**

This project brief outlines "PexelsSample," an Android application designed to enable users to search and browse images from the Pexels API. Key requirements include:

* Core functionality revolves around Pexels API integration for image search, paginated results display, and a detail view for images.  
* Emphasis is placed on a clean, modern UI/UX, though specific design choices are flexible.  
* Technical expectations are high, mandating Kotlin, Android best practices, scalable architecture, clean code, and separation of concerns.  
* The app must handle various states like loading, errors, and empty results.

### **Areas Requiring Special Attention**

* **API Interaction:** Robust handling of Pexels API requests, responses, and potential errors is crucial. Pagination logic needs to be seamless.  
* **UI Performance:** Displaying image grids and enabling smooth scrolling with image loading requires careful attention to performance and memory management.  
* **Architecture:** The choice and implementation of a modern, scalable architecture (e.g., MVVM, MVI with repository pattern) will be key to meeting technical expectations.  
* **State Management:** Comprehensive handling of UI states (loading, error, empty, content) is a core requirement.

### **Development Context**

This brief is based directly on a set of requirements provided for building a production-quality Android sample application. The focus is on demonstrating technical proficiency in Android development using modern tools and practices.

### **Guidance on PRD Detail**

* Please provide detailed user stories for each core feature: search input, results display (including item layout), pagination mechanism, and image detail view.  
* Specify expected behaviors for loading, error (network, API specific), and empty states.  
* While UI design is flexible, the PRD should emphasize the need for a "visually appealing," "clean," and "modern" layout.  
* Outline the expected components of the chosen architecture (e.g., ViewModel, Repository, Use Cases, Data Sources).  
* The PRD should clearly distinguish between MVP features and the listed "Bonus (Nice to Have)" features.

### **User Preferences**

* The app must be developed in Kotlin.  
* A strong preference for modern Android development practices (Jetpack libraries, coroutines, Flow, etc.) is implied by the requirements.  
* Creative freedom in UI design is encouraged, focusing on a high-quality user experience.
